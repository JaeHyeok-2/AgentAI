1. What task is the user trying to perform?

[cite_start]The user is trying to perform **image stylization**, specifically applying a "rainy painting style" to a scene, resulting in a "cinematic" look with "moody lighting and thick textures"[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The task involves understanding how AI combines these stylistic elements convincingly[cite: 1].

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow for cinematic rainy style transfer would leverage models capable of effectively separating content and style, learning meaningful representations of rain and background, and potentially mapping visual traits to deep learning features for a convincing aesthetic outcome.

* [cite_start]Input: An image[cite: 3].

* Model (Core Style Transfer Model):
    * [cite_start]**NST-fast-neural-style-rain-princess:** This model is a "fast neural style" model directly capable of applying a "rain-princess" style[cite: 6]. Neural style transfer models work by extracting content features from the input image and style features from a reference style, then combining them to generate a new image that has the content of the input but the style of the reference.

* Model (Related Concepts for Moody Lighting/Thick Textures/Convincing Combination):
    * [cite_start]**ARTxAI: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Curates Deep Representation Learning for Artistic Images using Fuzzy Techniques:** This paper highlights that artistic images "change drastically depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style"[cite: 8]. [cite_start]It shows how features from artistic image classification are suitable for other similar tasks[cite: 10]. [cite_start]Crucially, it proposes an explainable AI method to "map known visual traits of an image with the features used by the deep learning model considering fuzzy rules"[cite: 12]. [cite_start]These rules "show the patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task"[cite: 13]. This explains how the AI can understand and combine "moody lighting" and "thick textures" convincingly by correlating specific visual traits (like lighting patterns and texture characteristics) with the deep learning model's internal features. [cite_start]The model's "context-aware features can achieve ... more accurate results" [cite: 14] [cite_start]and some features "can be more clearly correlated to visual traits in the original image"[cite: 15], which allows for a more convincing artistic transformation.
    * [cite_start]**Harnessing Joint Rain-/Detail-aware Representations to Eliminate Intricate Rains (CoIC):** This model focuses on addressing various rainy images by "delving into meaningful representations that encapsulate both the rain and background components"[cite: 18]. [cite_start]It uses these representations as "instructive guidance" and employs a "Context-based Instance-level Modulation (CoI-M) mechanism"[cite: 19]. [cite_start]Furthermore, it devises a "rain-/detail-aware contrastive learning strategy to help extract joint rain-/detail-aware representations"[cite: 20]. [cite_start]By integrating these, CoIC is an "innovative and potent algorithm tailored for training models on mixed datasets" [cite: 21] [cite_start]and "enhances the deraining prowess remarkably when real-world dataset is included"[cite: 24]. While primarily for deraining, the ability of CoIC to learn and disentangle "rain and background components" and use "detail-aware representations" directly contributes to how the AI can convincingly overlay rainy style elements (like moody lighting and thick textures) onto a scene without losing its integrity, understanding where these elements naturally fit.
    * **AdvRain: Adversarial Raindrops to Attack Camera-based Smart Vision Systems:** This paper, while about adversarial attacks, offers insight into how rain effects manifest visually. [cite_start]It describes an attack based on "emulating the effects of a natural weather condition (i.e., Raindrops)" [cite: 31] [cite_start]by "blurring predefined parts of the captured image corresponding to the areas covered by the raindrop"[cite: 33]. Understanding such visual transformations, even for adversarial purposes, provides knowledge about the distinct visual patterns of rain that a style transfer model might incorporate to convincingly combine moody lighting and thick textures in a "rainy painting style."

* [cite_start]Output: The whole scene becomes cinematic with convincingly combined moody lighting and thick textures[cite: 1]. [cite_start]This is achieved by leveraging fast neural style transfer [cite: 6][cite_start], learning to map visual traits to deep learning features for aesthetic coherence [cite: 12][cite_start], and employing rain-/detail-aware representations to integrate rain elements naturally with the background[cite: 18].
