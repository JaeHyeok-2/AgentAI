ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I cleaned up a snowy night photo and the drifting flakes disappeared while the shop signs became sharp. How does AI distinguish snow from the actual scene so it can cleanly remove it?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is performing **image desnowing**, which involves removing snow particles of varying size and transparency from nighttime photos while preserving background clarity, like text and lights.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A nighttime photo degraded by drifting snowflakes of varying opacity.  
- **Model**:  
  - **CLAIO-DeSnow** applies multi-scale attention and edge-guided filters to isolate snow streaks/flakes by contrast and motion cues.  
  - The model preserves light-based textures (like neon or signage) while filtering transient snowy overlays.
- **Output**: A clean image with clear objects and no snow noise, especially around high-contrast regions like text.

### âœ… Summary:

CLAIO-DeSnow recognizes **snowflake blur patterns** and adapts filters to remove them while preserving fine, high-frequency content like signs. This makes it highly effective on snowy night images.
