ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"When I used AI on a ski resort photo, the falling snow vanished but the distant trees stayed detailed. What techniques allow the model to clear both thick and faint snow without losing scene integrity?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is doing **depth-aware and texture-preserving desnowing**, where both foreground snow and subtle background haze need to be removed without degrading scene content.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A snow-covered outdoor photo with both close-up flakes and distant scene detail.  
- **Model**:  
  - **CLAIO-DeSnow** processes the image using layered spatial attention. Large flakes are removed using high-contrast detection, while faint ones are treated with frequency filtering.  
  - GeoAI methods like SparseInst-inspired modules localize fine structures like trees and enhance their retention.
- **Output**: A crisp photo with both large/faint snow gone and scene features intact.

### âœ… Summary:

CLAIO-DeSnow separates snow layers by analyzing **spatial frequency, motion blur, and local contrast**. It removes both thick and fine snowflakes while **preserving natural textures** like trees and mountain lines.
