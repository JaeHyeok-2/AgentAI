1. What task is the user trying to perform?

[cite_start]The user is trying to perform **snow removal (desnowing)** from winter photos, specifically removing "snow blobs and light flurries" of "different shapes and opacity"[cite: 21]. [cite_start]The task is to restore the images as if "snow was never there"[cite: 21], implying a need for robust handling of varied snow characteristics.

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow for desnowing different snow types would involve models capable of distinguishing snow from background through meaningful representations and potentially using context or additional information to guide the removal process.

* [cite_start]Input: Winter photos filled with snow blobs and light flurries[cite: 21].

* Model (Core Snow Removal Model):
    * [cite_start]**WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeSnow:** This model is directly recommended for weather removal, including desnowing[cite: 26].

* Model (Related Concepts for Handling Diverse Snow Types/Opaque Elements):
    * [cite_start]**Harnessing Joint Rain-/Detail-aware Representations to Eliminate Intricate Rains (CoIC):** This model focuses on "addressing various rainy images by delving into meaningful representations that encapsulate both the rain and background components"[cite: 28]. [cite_start]It uses a "Context-based Instance-level Modulation (CoI-M) mechanism adept at efficiently modulating CNN- or Transformer-based models" [cite: 29] [cite_start]and a "rain-/detail-aware contrastive learning strategy to help extract joint rain-/detail-aware representations"[cite: 30]. [cite_start]While specifically for rain, this approach of learning to distinguish "rain" from "details" and handling "diverse rain types" [cite: 27] is highly analogous to distinguishing snow of different shapes and opacity from the actual scene. [cite_start]CoIC's efficacy in "boosting the deraining ability... when real-world dataset is included" [cite: 34] suggests robustness to real-world weather variations.
    * [cite_start]**Removing Reflections from RAW Photos:** This system removes real-world reflections from images[cite: 35]. [cite_start]It operates on linear (RAW) photos [cite: 36] [cite_start]and can accept an "optional contextual photo looking in the opposite direction" to "disambiguate what should be considered the reflection"[cite: 37]. [cite_start]It is trained on "synthetic mixtures of real RAW photos" [cite: 38] [cite_start]using a "photometrically and geometrically accurate" reflection simulation[cite: 38]. This is relevant because "snow blobs and light flurries" can act as superimposed elements, similar to reflections. [cite_start]The model's ability to disambiguate and remove reflections [cite: 37] suggests a mechanism to identify and separate such translucent or opaque overlays, which could be adapted to snow of varying opacities.
    * [cite_start]**ColMix -- A Simple Data Augmentation Framework to Improve Object Detector Performance and Robustness in Aerial Images:** This work introduces data augmentation methods, including "collage pasting" [cite: 45] [cite_start]and "ColMix" [cite: 48][cite_start], to improve object detector performance and robustness, especially against "image corruptions"[cite: 47, 49]. [cite_start]While for object detection, the ability to make detectors "robust to various corruptions" [cite: 49] implies a general robustness to visual noise, which could help a desnowing model maintain performance when faced with different snow characteristics.

* Output: The winter photos look as if snow was never there, as the models handle snow of different shapes and opacity by learning distinct representations for snow and background, potentially leveraging contextual information or robust corruption handling techniques.
