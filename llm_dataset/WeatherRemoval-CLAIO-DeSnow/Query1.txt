You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I cleaned up a snowy night photo and the drifting flakes disappeared while the shop signs became sharp. How does AI distinguish snow from the actual scene so it can cleanly remove it?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Real-time GeoAI for High-resolution Mapping and Segmentation of Arctic Permafrost Features
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05341v1.pdf
Summary: This paper introduces a real-time GeoAI workflow for large-scale image analysis and the segmentation of Arctic permafrost features at a fine-granularity. Very high-resolution (0.5m) commercial imagery is used in this analysis. To achieve real-time prediction, our workflow employs a lightweight, deep learning-based instance segmentation model, SparseInst, which introduces and uses Instance Activation Maps to accurately locate the position of objects within the image scene. Experimental results show that the model can achieve better accuracy of prediction at a much faster inference speed than the popular Mask-RCNN model.

Model: Quality Assured: Rethinking Annotation Strategies in Imaging AI
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17596v2.pdf
Summary: This paper does not describe a novel method. Instead, it studies an essential foundation for reliable benchmarking and ultimately real-world application of AI-based image analysis: generating high-quality reference annotations. Previous research has focused on crowdsourcing as a means of outsourcing annotations. However, little attention has so far been given to annotation companies, specifically regarding their internal quality assurance (QA) processes. Therefore, our aim is to evaluate the influence of QA employed by annotation companies on annotation quality and devise methodologies for maximizing data annotation efficacy. Based on a total of 57,648 instance segmented images obtained from a total of 924 annotators and 34 QA workers from four annotation companies and Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we derived the following insights: (1) Annotation companies perform better both in terms of quantity and quality compared to the widely used platform MTurk. (2) Annotation companies' internal QA only provides marginal improvements, if any. However, improving labeling instructions instead of investing in QA can substantially boost annotation performance. (3) The benefit of internal QA depends on specific image characteristics. Our work could enable researchers to derive substantially more value from a fixed annotation budget and change the way annotation companies conduct internal QA.
