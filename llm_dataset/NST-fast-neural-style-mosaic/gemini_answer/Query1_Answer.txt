1. What task is the user trying to perform?

[cite_start]The user is trying to perform **image stylization**, specifically applying a "mosaic painting" style to an image, resulting in "tile-like color blocks with a Cubist vibe"[cite: 24]. [cite_start]The task involves precisely segmenting the scene into tiles while preserving the original shapes and ensuring real-time processing for video[cite: 24].

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow for real-time mosaic stylization would involve models capable of efficiently segmenting images into abstract geometric units while preserving underlying semantic shapes, optimized for high performance on video streams.

* Input: An image (or video frame) from the user.

* Model (Core Style Transfer Model):
    * [cite_start]**NST-fast-neural-style-mosaic:** This model is a "fast neural style" model directly designed to convert images into a mosaic painting style[cite: 29]. [cite_start]Its "fast" nature is crucial for real-time video processing[cite: 24].

* Model (Related Concepts for Slicing, Shape Preservation, and Efficiency):
    * [cite_start]**Image Triangulation Using the Sobel Operator for Vertex Selection:** This paper discusses an image triangulation algorithm that "decomposes images into triangles" [cite: 39] [cite_start]and "deliberately employs simplification to create an abstracted representation"[cite: 39]. [cite_start]It utilizes "Sobel edge detection and point cloud sparsification to determine final vertices for a triangulation" [cite: 41][cite_start], resulting in "artistic triangulated compositions"[cite: 41]. [cite_start]This directly explains how AI "decides where to slice the scene into tiles" by using edge detection to identify significant vertices that define shapes, enabling geometric abstraction while "keeping the shapes intact"[cite: 24].
    * [cite_start]**ARTxAI: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Curates Deep Representation Learning for Artistic Images using Fuzzy Techniques:** This paper highlights that artistic images "change drastically depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style"[cite: 31]. [cite_start]It shows how features from artistic image classification are suitable for other similar tasks [cite: 33] [cite_start]and proposes an explainable AI method to "map known visual traits of an image with the features used by the deep learning model"[cite: 35]. [cite_start]This mapping uses "fuzzy rules" that show "patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task"[cite: 36], ensuring that the model can understand and preserve visual traits (shapes) while applying an artistic style. [cite_start]It indicates that "context-aware features can achieve ... more accurate results" [cite: 37] [cite_start]and that some features "can be more clearly correlated to visual traits in the original image"[cite: 38]. This helps the AI stylize effectively without losing scene recognition.
    * [cite_start]**ActiveSplat: High-Fidelity Scene Reconstruction through Active Gaussian Splatting:** This system leverages "efficient and realistic rendering" [cite: 43] [cite_start]and establishes a "unified framework for online mapping, viewpoint selection, and path planning"[cite: 43]. [cite_start]While for 3D reconstruction, its core strength lies in its "efficient and realistic rendering" [cite: 43] [cite_start]and "high-fidelity reconstruction with photorealistic view synthesis"[cite: 46]. [cite_start]The "efficient decision-making" [cite: 45] [cite_start]and "hierarchical planning strategy" [cite: 46] [cite_start]that mitigate "repetitive trajectories" and improve "local granularity" [cite: 46] [cite_start]explain how computations are kept "light" [cite: 24] for real-time video processing, as it can efficiently process and render complex visual information.

* Output: The image is transformed into tile-like color blocks with a Cubist vibe, where the scene is sliced into tiles based on image triangulation using edge detection, and computations are kept light for real-time video processing through efficient rendering and optimization techniques.
