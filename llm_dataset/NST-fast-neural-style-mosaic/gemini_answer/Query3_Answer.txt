1. What task is the user trying to perform?

[cite_start]The user is trying to perform **image stylization**, specifically applying a mosaic-like effect where the "whole image split into neat color blocks without losing structure"[cite: 49]. The core task is to determine the optimal boundaries for these "tiles" while meticulously preserving the original image's structural integrity.

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow for structured image stylization would involve models that can accurately detect object boundaries, segment images into meaningful regions, and adaptively determine tiling granularity to preserve overall structure.

* Input: An image.

* Model (Core Style Transfer Model):
    * [cite_start]**NST-fast-neural-style-mosaic:** This model is a "fast neural style" model that can produce mosaic-like stylizations[cite: 54].

* Model (Related Concepts for Tiling Boundaries and Structure Preservation):
    * [cite_start]**Image Triangulation Using the Sobel Operator for Vertex Selection:** This paper discusses "Image triangulation, the practice of decomposing images into triangles" [cite: 55][cite_start], which "deliberately employs simplification to create an abstracted representation"[cite: 55]. [cite_start]It uses "Sobel edge detection" to "determine final vertices for a triangulation" [cite: 56][cite_start], resulting in "artistic triangulated compositions"[cite: 56]. [cite_start]This directly explains how the AI "figures out where one tile should end and another begin" [cite: 49] by identifying significant edges and corners of objects, ensuring that the "neat color blocks" align with the scene's inherent structure.
    * [cite_start]**Geo-Tiles for Semantic Segmentation of Earth Observation Imagery:** This paper proposes a "tiling scheme that creates geo-tiles based on the geo-information of the raster data"[cite: 61]. [cite_start]The "selection of subimages (comprising size, location and orientation) is crucial" [cite: 59] [cite_start]as it "affects the available context information of each pixel"[cite: 60]. [cite_start]This tiling scheme offers "flexible customization properties regarding tile granularity, tile stride and image boundary alignment" [cite: 63][cite_start], and "generates tiles [that] show a consistent spatial tile extent"[cite: 65]. [cite_start]While for Earth observation, the principles of creating geometrically consistent tiles that preserve context and align with boundaries are directly applicable to how an AI divides an image into "neat color blocks without losing structure"[cite: 49].
    * [cite_start]**When Semantic Segmentation Meets Frequency Aliasing:** This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of "hard pixel errors" in semantic segmentation, revealing a quantitative association between them and "aliasing" (distortion from overlapping frequency components during downsampling)[cite: 71]. [cite_start]To alleviate aliasing, it proposes "de-aliasing filter (DAF) and frequency mixing (FreqMix) modules" that "accurately remov[e] or adjust[] frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency"[cite: 75]. This is relevant because avoiding aliasing ensures that sharp edges and structural details are preserved when an image is processed into blocks. [cite_start]The "consistent improvements in semantic segmentation" [cite: 77] [cite_start]suggest that models can indeed maintain structural integrity by handling frequency components, helping the AI ensure that the "whole image split into neat color blocks without losing structure"[cite: 49].

* Output: The whole image is split into neat color blocks without losing structure, as the AI figures out tile boundaries using edge detection and image triangulation, leverages tiling schemes that preserve context and align with geo-information, and employs techniques to prevent aliasing, ensuring structural integrity during the stylization process.
