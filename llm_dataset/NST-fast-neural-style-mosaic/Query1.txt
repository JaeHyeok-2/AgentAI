You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I asked to “turn it into a mosaic painting,” and every patch of the image snapped into tile-like color blocks with a Cubist vibe. How does AI decide where to slice the scene into tiles while keeping the shapes intact? And since it runs in real time on video, what tricks keep the computations so light?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: ARTxAI: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Curates Deep Representation Learning for Artistic Images using Fuzzy Techniques
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15284v1.pdf
Summary: Automatic art analysis employs different image processing techniques to classify and categorize works of art. When working with artistic images, we need to take into account further considerations compared to classical image processing. This is because such artistic paintings change drastically depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style. This can result in features that perform very well in a given task but do not grasp the whole of the visual and symbolic information contained in a painting. In this paper, we show how the features obtained from different tasks in artistic image classification are suitable to solve other ones of similar nature. We present different methods to improve the generalization capabilities and performance of artistic classification systems. Furthermore, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence method to map known visual traits of an image with the features used by the deep learning model considering fuzzy rules. These rules show the patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task and how effective is each of the patterns found. Our results show that our proposed context-aware features can achieve up to $6\%$ and $26\%$ more accurate results than other context- and non-context-aware solutions, respectively, depending on the specific task. We also show that some of the features used by these models can be more clearly correlated to visual traits in the original image than others.

Model: Image Triangulation Using the Sobel Operator for Vertex Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16112v1.pdf
Summary: Image triangulation, the practice of decomposing images into triangles, deliberately employs simplification to create an abstracted representation. While triangulating an image is a relatively simple process, difficulties arise when determining which vertices produce recognizable and visually pleasing output images. With the goal of producing art, we discuss an image triangulation algorithm in Python that utilizes Sobel edge detection and point cloud sparsification to determine final vertices for a triangulation, resulting in the creation of artistic triangulated compositions.

Model: ActiveSplat: High-Fidelity Scene Reconstruction through Active Gaussian Splatting
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21955v1.pdf
Summary: We propose ActiveSplat, an autonomous high-fidelity reconstruction system leveraging Gaussian splatting. Taking advantage of efficient and realistic rendering, the system establishes a unified framework for online mapping, viewpoint selection, and path planning. The key to ActiveSplat is a hybrid map representation that integrates both dense information about the environment and a sparse abstraction of the workspace. Therefore, the system leverages sparse topology for efficient viewpoint sampling and path planning, while exploiting view-dependent dense prediction for viewpoint selection, facilitating efficient decision-making with promising accuracy and completeness. A hierarchical planning strategy based on the topological map is adopted to mitigate repetitive trajectories and improve local granularity given limited time budgets, ensuring high-fidelity reconstruction with photorealistic view synthesis. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction accuracy, data coverage, and exploration efficiency. The released code will be available on our project page: https://li-yuetao.github.io/ActiveSplat/.
