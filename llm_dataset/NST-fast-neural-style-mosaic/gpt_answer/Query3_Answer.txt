🧠 User Question:
"I saw the whole image split into neat color blocks without losing structure. How does the AI figure out where one tile should end and another begin?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?
The user is applying **edge-aware artistic segmentation** in neural stylization, focusing on block-based stylization while keeping structure coherent.

---

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?
**Input → Model → Output**  
- **Input**: An input photo to be stylized in tile/patch format.  
- **Model**:  
  - **NST-fast-neural-style-mosaic** handles color and texture application.  
  - For tiling, techniques like **image triangulation using Sobel operators** guide vertex placement, using edges to define tile boundaries.  
  - Geo-aware tiling methods (e.g., in EarthObservationTiles) or de-aliasing techniques help prevent edge distortion.  
- **Output**: A stylized image with coherent segmentation into colored tiles.
