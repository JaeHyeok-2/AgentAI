🧠 User Question:
"My photo turned into colorful geometric tiles while all the main shapes stayed untouched. How does AI manage to stylize each section while keeping the scene recognizable?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?
The task is **semantic-preserving artistic style transfer**, applying stylized geometric textures while maintaining the image’s recognizable structure and layout.

---

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?
**Input → Model → Output**  
- **Input**: A photo and a mosaic-style model.  
- **Model**:  
  - **NST-fast-neural-style-mosaic** transforms features from a pretrained VGG network to inject stylistic textures while preserving layout and boundaries via content loss.  
  - Cross-attention or segmentation-aware backbones (e.g. CA2SIS) may also enhance fidelity to semantic layout.  
- **Output**: Geometrically rich, stylistically transformed image with intact content boundaries.
