Based on the provided models and papers, here is the analysis of the user's question about learning painterly texture for impressionist oil landscapes:

## 1. Task Analysis
The user is performing **text-to-image generation with painterly texture synthesis** for impressionist oil landscapes. This involves generating images with thick, tactile brush strokes that mimic the physical characteristics of real oil paint application, requiring specialized understanding of artistic texture and brushwork techniques.

## 2. CNAPS AI-like Workflow (Input → Model → Output)

  - Composite Layout and Image Score (CLIS) ensuring quality of generated painterly textures
  - Customized synthetic sample generation addressing texture representation challenges in artistic domains

**Output:** Impressionist oil landscape with thick, tactile brush strokes and realistic painterly texture that appears physically dimensional

## 3. Extra Information Required for Painterly Texture Learning
AI models need specialized training on:
- **Multi-scale texture datasets:** High-resolution images capturing fine brush stroke details and paint thickness variations
- **Physical paint properties:** Understanding of how oil paint behaves, dries, and creates surface texture
- **Artist technique analysis:** Brush stroke direction, pressure, and layering methods specific to impressionist techniques
- **Contextual texture mapping:** Relationship between subject matter and appropriate texture application
- **Quality assessment metrics:** Specialized evaluation criteria for painterly texture authenticity and visual appeal
