1. What task is the user trying to perform?

[cite_start]The user is trying to perform **text-to-image synthesis with artistic style transfer**, specifically generating an "impressionist oil landscape" where the "brush strokes looked thick enough to feel"[cite: 30]. [cite_start]The user is asking about the "extra information" AI needs to learn to mimic painterly texture[cite: 30].

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow for generating textured artistic images from text would involve models capable of deep stylistic representation, leveraging human language for semantic understanding, and ensuring high-quality synthesis of textural details.

* [cite_start]Input: A text prompt like "impressionist oil landscape"[cite: 30].

* Model (Core Text-to-Image Model):
    * [cite_start]**Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-ImpressionismOil:** This model is a text-to-image model, specifically fine-tuned or designed to generate images in an "Impressionism Oil" style[cite: 35]. It translates the text description into a visual output, including the desired painterly texture.

* Model (Related Concepts for Painterly Texture Mimicry):
    * [cite_start]**ARTxAI: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Curates Deep Representation Learning for Artistic Images using Fuzzy Techniques:** This paper highlights that artistic paintings "change drastically depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style"[cite: 37]. [cite_start]It proposes an explainable AI method to "map known visual traits of an image with the features used by the deep learning model considering fuzzy rules"[cite: 41]. [cite_start]These rules "show the patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task"[cite: 42]. [cite_start]This explains how AI learns to mimic painterly texture by understanding and correlating specific visual traits (like thick brush strokes) in artistic images with its internal features, ensuring context-aware and accurate style application[cite: 43, 44].
    * [cite_start]**FedStyle: Style-Based Federated Learning Crowdsourcing Framework for Art Commissions:** This framework allows artists to "learn their abstract style representations and align with the server"[cite: 50]. [cite_start]It introduces "contrastive learning to meticulously construct the style representation space, pulling artworks with similar styles closer and keeping different ones apart in the embedding space"[cite: 51]. [cite_start]This process explains how AI gains the "extra information" needed to mimic painterly texture: it learns robust and abstract representations of artistic styles by comparing and differentiating them, allowing it to generate textures like thick brush strokes [cite: 30] that are semantically aligned with the desired style.
    * [cite_start]**Auto Cherry-Picker: Learning from High-quality Generative Data Driven by Language:** This framework generates "high-quality cross-modality training samples at scale to augment perception and multi-modal training"[cite: 55]. [cite_start]It uses LLMs to "sample descriptions and layouts based on object combinations from real data priors" [cite: 56][cite_start], and then uses a controllable diffusion model to "generate multiple images"[cite: 57]. [cite_start]The generated data is refined using a "Composite Layout and Image Score (CLIS) to ensure quality"[cite: 58]. This process provides the AI with high-quality synthetic data for training, which includes diverse and realistic painterly textures, thus supplying the "extra information" needed to generate convincing textures. [cite_start]The quality metric (CLIS) ensures that the learned textures are high-fidelity[cite: 58, 61].

* [cite_start]Output: An impressionist oil landscape with brush strokes thick enough to feel[cite: 30]. This is achieved by text-to-image models that learn to map visual traits of artistic styles to deep learning features, meticulously construct style representation spaces using contrastive learning, and are trained on high-quality generative data driven by language to ensure realistic texture synthesis.
