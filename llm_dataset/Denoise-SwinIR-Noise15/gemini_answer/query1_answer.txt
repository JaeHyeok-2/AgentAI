Based on the provided models and papers, here is the analysis of the user's question about AI image restoration from heavily degraded and noisy images:

## 1. Task Analysis
The user is performing **image restoration and denoising** from heavily degraded images. This involves recovering high-quality, clean images from degraded versions affected by various types of noise, artifacts, and quality deterioration.

## 2. CNAPS AI-like Workflow (Input → Model → Output)

**Input:** Heavily degraded image with noise, artifacts, and quality deterioration

**Model Processing:**
- **ResShift (Inpainting-ResShift-ImageNet)** serves as the primary restoration framework that:
  - Applies residual shifting techniques to progressively restore image quality
  - Handles complex degradations through multi-scale processing
  - Utilizes advanced inpainting capabilities for missing or corrupted regions
- **Noise-Space Domain Adaptation** enhances restoration by:
  - Leveraging diffusion models for domain adaptation via noise space
  - Applying denoising as adaptation methodology to align synthetic and real-world data
  - Using channel-shuffling layers and residual-swapping contrastive learning
- **CNN AutoEncoder-based denoising** provides specialized noise removal through:
  - Deep learning models operating in both spatial and frequency domains
  - Tailored denoising techniques for specific noise categories (salt & pepper, Gaussian, periodic)
  - Integration of noise detection into the restoration pipeline

**Output:** High-quality restored image with significantly reduced noise and improved visual clarity

## 3. Technical Implementation and Training Data
The restoration capability stems from:
- **Synthetic training data:** Models train on carefully synthesized degradation patterns that simulate real-world noise and artifacts
- **Domain adaptation:** Diffusion-based methods bridge the gap between synthetic training data and real-world degradations
- **Multi-domain learning:** Training across spatial and frequency domains enables comprehensive noise understanding
- **Progressive restoration:** Multi-step denoising processes gradually improve image quality while preserving important details
