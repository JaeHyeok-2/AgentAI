Based on the provided models and papers, here is the analysis of the user's question about AI restoration of heavily degraded and noisy images:

## 1. Task Analysis
The user is performing **comprehensive image restoration** from heavily degraded photos. This involves recovering high-quality images from inputs affected by multiple types of degradation including noise, blur, artifacts, and quality deterioration through advanced AI techniques.

## 2. CNAPS AI-like Workflow (Input → Model → Output)

**Input:** Heavily degraded photo with significant noise, artifacts, and quality issues

**Model Processing:**
- **SwinIR (Denoise-SwinIR-Noise15)** serves as the core restoration architecture that:
  - Utilizes Swin Transformer architecture for hierarchical feature learning
  - Applies window-based self-attention mechanisms for efficient processing
  - Handles various restoration tasks including denoising, super-resolution, and artifact removal
- **HAIR (Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration)** enhances adaptability by:
  - Using a Classifier to generate Global Information Vector (GIV) containing degradation information
  - Employing Hyper Selecting Net (HSN) to dynamically generate parameters for specific degradations
  - Enabling plug-and-play integration with existing restoration models for improved performance
- **Quality Assured annotation strategies** ensure robust training through:
  - High-quality reference annotations for reliable model training
  - Improved labeling instructions that substantially boost restoration performance
  - Strategic annotation approaches that maximize data annotation efficacy

**Output:** Restored high-quality image with dramatically improved clarity, reduced noise, and enhanced visual fidelity

## 3. Technical Implementation and Training Data
The successful restoration capability results from:
- **Dynamic parameter adaptation:** HAIR generates degradation-specific parameters, allowing models to adapt to different noise types and degradation patterns
- **Transformer-based architecture:** SwinIR leverages the power of vision transformers for capturing long-range dependencies in image restoration
- **High-quality training data:** Strategic annotation processes ensure robust model training with properly labeled degradation examples
- **All-in-one approach:** Models can handle multiple degradation types simultaneously while maintaining specialized performance for each task
