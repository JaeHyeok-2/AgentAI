You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"There was this golden glow with real depth, like in high-budget cinema. What does AI do differently to get this dramatic atmosphere and precision?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

Model: Artificial Intelligence and Aesthetic Judgment
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12338v1.pdf
Summary: Generative AIs produce creative outputs in the style of human expression. We argue that encounters with the outputs of modern generative AI models are mediated by the same kinds of aesthetic judgments that organize our interactions with artwork. The interpretation procedure we use on art we find in museums is not an innate human faculty, but one developed over history by disciplines such as art history and art criticism to fulfill certain social functions. This gives us pause when considering our reactions to generative AI, how we should approach this new medium, and why generative AI seems to incite so much fear about the future. We naturally inherit a conundrum of causal inference from the history of art: a work can be read as a symptom of the cultural conditions that influenced its creation while simultaneously being framed as a timeless, seemingly acausal distillation of an eternal human condition. In this essay, we focus on an unresolved tension when we bring this dilemma to bear in the context of generative AI: are we looking for proof that generated media reflects something about the conditions that created it or some eternal human essence? Are current modes of interpretation sufficient for this task? Historically, new forms of art have changed how art is interpreted, with such influence used as evidence that a work of art has touched some essential human truth. As generative AI influences contemporary aesthetic judgment we outline some of the pitfalls and traps in attempting to scrutinize what AI generated media means.

Model: Hedonic Prices and Quality Adjusted Price Indices Powered by AI
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00044v1.pdf
Summary: We develop empirical models that efficiently process large amounts of unstructured product data (text, images, prices, quantities) to produce accurate hedonic price estimates and derived indices. To achieve this, we generate abstract product attributes (or ``features'') from descriptions and images using deep neural networks. These attributes are then used to estimate the hedonic price function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we apply the models to Amazon's data for first-party apparel sales, and estimate hedonic prices. The resulting models have a very high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ ranging from $80\%$ to $90\%$. Finally, we construct the AI-based hedonic Fisher price index, chained at the year-over-year frequency, and contrast it with the CPI and other electronic indices.

Model: AI-generated Image Quality Assessment in Visual Communication
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15677v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/ytian73/aigi-vc
Summary: Assessing the quality of artificial intelligence-generated images (AIGIs) plays a crucial role in their application in real-world scenarios. However, traditional image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms primarily focus on low-level visual perception, while existing IQA works on AIGIs overemphasize the generated content itself, neglecting its effectiveness in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AIGI-VC, a quality assessment database for AI-Generated Images in Visual Communication, which studies the communicability of AIGIs in the advertising field from the perspectives of information clarity and emotional interaction. The dataset consists of 2,500 images spanning 14 advertisement topics and 8 emotion types. It provides coarse-grained human preference annotations and fine-grained preference descriptions, benchmarking the abilities of IQA methods in preference prediction, interpretation, and reasoning. We conduct an empirical study of existing representative IQA methods and large multi-modal models on the AIGI-VC dataset, uncovering their strengths and weaknesses.
