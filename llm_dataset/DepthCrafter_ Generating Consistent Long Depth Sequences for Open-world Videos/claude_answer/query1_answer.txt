Based on the provided models and papers, here is the analysis of the user's question about creating smooth, consistent depth maps for video frames:

## 1. Task Analysis
The user is performing **temporal depth estimation for video sequences** or **video-based 3D scene reconstruction**. This involves generating consistent depth maps across all frames in a video sequence, maintaining temporal coherence while creating a 3D representation of the scene that appears "alive" with proper depth relationships.

## 2. CNAPS AI-like Workflow (Input → Model → Output)

**Input:** Regular video clip containing multiple frames with varying scenes and camera movements

**Model Processing:**
- **DepthCrafter** serves as the primary framework for consistent long-term depth sequence generation by:
  - Processing entire video sequences to maintain temporal consistency across frames
  - Generating smooth depth transitions between consecutive frames
  - Handling open-world video content without requiring specific scene constraints
- **Make-It-4D framework** enhances 4D scene understanding through:
  - Utilizing layered depth images (LDIs) to represent complex scene geometry
  - Unprojecting LDIs to form feature point clouds for 3D representation
  - Displacing feature point clouds based on scene flow and camera pose estimation
  - Maintaining global consistency across long-term dynamic sequences
- **Multi-View Differentiable Rendering** provides depth refinement via:
  - Leveraging monocular depth estimation as initial topology-complete input
  - Scaling depth maps to absolute distances using structure-from-motion
  - Transforming depths to triangle surface meshes for geometric representation
  - Enforcing photometric and geometric consistency through local optimization

**Output:** Smooth, temporally consistent depth maps for every frame, creating a coherent 3D representation of the entire video sequence

## 3. Technical Implementation for Temporal Consistency
The temporal consistency capability stems from:
- **Long-sequence processing:** DepthCrafter specifically designed for generating consistent depth sequences across extended video periods
- **4D representation:** Make-It-4D maintains global consistency by tracking both 3D geometry and scene motion over time
- **Feature point cloud tracking:** Dynamic displacement of feature clouds based on motion estimation ensures smooth depth transitions
- **Multi-view constraints:** Differentiable rendering enforces view consistency across multiple frames
- **Structure-from-motion integration:** Absolute depth scaling ensures metric consistency throughout the sequence
