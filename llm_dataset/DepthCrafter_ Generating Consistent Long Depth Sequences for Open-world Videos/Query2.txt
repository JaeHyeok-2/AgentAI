Model: R3D3: Dense 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes from Multiple Cameras
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14713v1.pdf
Summary: Dense 3D reconstruction and ego-motion estimation are key challenges in autonomous driving and robotics. Compared to the complex, multi-modal systems deployed today, multi-camera systems provide a simpler, low-cost alternative. However, camera-based 3D reconstruction of complex dynamic scenes has proven extremely difficult, as existing solutions often produce incomplete or incoherent results. We propose R3D3, a multi-camera system for dense 3D reconstruction and ego-motion estimation. Our approach iterates between geometric estimation that exploits spatial-temporal information from multiple cameras, and monocular depth refinement. We integrate multi-camera feature correlation and dense bundle adjustment operators that yield robust geometric depth and pose estimates. To improve reconstruction where geometric depth is unreliable, e.g. for moving objects or low-textured regions, we introduce learnable scene priors via a depth refinement network. We show that this design enables a dense, consistent 3D reconstruction of challenging, dynamic outdoor environments. Consequently, we achieve state-of-the-art dense depth prediction on the DDAD and NuScenes benchmarks.

Model: MegaSaM: Accurate, Fast, and Robust Structure and Motion from Casual Dynamic Videos
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04463v2.pdf
Summary: We present a system that allows for accurate, fast, and robust estimation of camera parameters and depth maps from casual monocular videos of dynamic scenes. Most conventional structure from motion and monocular SLAM techniques assume input videos that feature predominantly static scenes with large amounts of parallax. Such methods tend to produce erroneous estimates in the absence of these conditions. Recent neural network-based approaches attempt to overcome these challenges; however, such methods are either computationally expensive or brittle when run on dynamic videos with uncontrolled camera motion or unknown field of view. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of a deep visual SLAM framework: with careful modifications to its training and inference schemes, this system can scale to real-world videos of complex dynamic scenes with unconstrained camera paths, including videos with little camera parallax. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos demonstrate that our system is significantly more accurate and robust at camera pose and depth estimation when compared with prior and concurrent work, with faster or comparable running times.

Model: Make-It-4D: Synthesizing a Consistent Long-Term Dynamic Scene Video from a Single Image
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10257v1.pdf
Summary: We study the problem of synthesizing a long-term dynamic video from only a single image. This is challenging since it requires consistent visual content movements given large camera motions. Existing methods either hallucinate inconsistent perpetual views or struggle with long camera trajectories. To address these issues, it is essential to estimate the underlying 4D (including 3D geometry and scene motion) and fill in the occluded regions. To this end, we present Make-It-4D, a novel method that can generate a consistent long-term dynamic video from a single image. On the one hand, we utilize layered depth images (LDIs) to represent a scene, and they are then unprojected to form a feature point cloud. To animate the visual content, the feature point cloud is displaced based on the scene flow derived from motion estimation and the corresponding camera pose. Such 4D representation enables our method to maintain the global consistency of the generated dynamic video. On the other hand, we fill in the occluded regions by using a pretrained diffusion model to inpaint and outpaint the input image. This enables our method to work under large camera motions. Benefiting from our design, our method can be training-free which saves a significant amount of training time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which showcases compelling rendering results.
