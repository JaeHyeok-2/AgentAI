1. What task is the user trying to perform?

[cite_start]The user is trying to perform **dense 3D reconstruction and depth estimation in dynamic scenes** from monocular or multi-camera video, specifically ensuring depth stability and accuracy even when people or objects move quickly[cite: 53].

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow emphasizes robustness and accuracy in challenging, dynamic environments, leveraging advanced techniques to overcome limitations of traditional methods in dynamic scene understanding.

* [cite_start]Input: Video footage where people or objects move quickly[cite: 53].

* Model (Core Depth/3D Reconstruction Models for Dynamic Scenes):
    * [cite_start]**DepthCrafter: Generating Consistent Long Depth Sequences for Open-world Videos:** This model is designed for generating consistent depth sequences in videos, which is crucial for handling dynamic elements consistently[cite: 58].
    * [cite_start]**R3D3: Dense 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes from Multiple Cameras:** This multi-camera system performs dense 3D reconstruction and ego-motion estimation, addressing challenges in complex dynamic scenes where existing solutions are often incomplete or incoherent[cite: 59, 60, 61]. [cite_start]It iterates between geometric estimation (exploiting spatio-temporal information from multiple cameras) and monocular depth refinement[cite: 62]. [cite_start]It integrates multi-camera feature correlation and dense bundle adjustment for robust geometric depth and pose estimates[cite: 63]. [cite_start]To improve reconstruction for moving objects or low-textured regions where geometric depth is unreliable, it introduces learnable scene priors via a depth refinement network[cite: 64]. [cite_start]This design enables dense, consistent 3D reconstruction of challenging, dynamic outdoor environments[cite: 65].
    * [cite_start]**MegaSaM: Accurate, Fast, and Robust Structure and Motion from Casual Dynamic Videos:** This system allows for accurate, fast, and robust estimation of camera parameters and depth maps from casual monocular videos of dynamic scenes[cite: 67]. [cite_start]Unlike conventional methods that assume predominantly static scenes, MegaSaM can scale to real-world videos of complex dynamic scenes with unconstrained camera paths, including those with little camera parallax, through careful modifications to its training and inference schemes[cite: 68, 69, 70, 71]. [cite_start]It is significantly more accurate and robust at camera pose and depth estimation[cite: 72].
    * [cite_start]**Make-It-4D: Synthesizing a Consistent Long-Term Dynamic Scene Video from a Single Image:** This method generates a consistent long-term dynamic video from a single image[cite: 77, 74]. [cite_start]It addresses the challenge of consistent visual content movements given large camera motions and fills in occluded regions[cite: 75, 76, 81]. [cite_start]It maintains global consistency by estimating underlying 4D (3D geometry and scene motion)[cite: 76, 80].

* Model (Inference Phase - CNAPS-like adaptation for dynamic scenes):
    * [cite_start]**DepthCrafter** ensures "consistent long depth sequences" for videos[cite: 58], directly supporting stable depth in dynamic settings.
    * [cite_start]**R3D3**'s design, which integrates multi-camera spatial-temporal information, dense bundle adjustment, and learnable scene priors for depth refinement, is specifically tailored for "dense, consistent 3D reconstruction of challenging, dynamic outdoor environments" and for handling "moving objects"[cite: 62, 63, 64, 65].
    * [cite_start]**MegaSaM** is built to provide "accurate, fast, and robust estimation of camera parameters and depth maps from casual monocular videos of dynamic scenes" [cite: 67][cite_start], overcoming limitations of traditional methods in dynamic contexts[cite: 68, 71, 72].
    * [cite_start]**Make-It-4D** generates videos with "consistent visual content movements" by estimating underlying 4D information and handling occlusions[cite: 74, 76, 80], which ensures stability and accuracy even with dynamic elements.

* [cite_start]Output: Depth that remains stable and accurate even when people or objects move quickly[cite: 53].
