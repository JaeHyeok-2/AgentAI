1. What task is the user trying to perform?

[cite_start]The user is trying to perform **video depth estimation and 3D scene reconstruction**, specifically generating a smooth and consistent depth map for every frame of a regular video clip to make the whole scene appear in 3D[cite: 27]. [cite_start]The key challenge is maintaining consistency over time[cite: 27].

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow emphasizes maintaining consistency over long sequences and handling underlying 3D geometry and motion to create dynamic 3D representations from limited input.

* [cite_start]Input: A regular video clip[cite: 27].

* Model (Core Depth/3D Scene Generation Models):
    * [cite_start]**DepthCrafter: Generating Consistent Long Depth Sequences for Open-world Videos:** This model is designed for generating consistent depth sequences in videos[cite: 32]. This directly addresses the user's need for smooth and consistent depth maps over time.
    * [cite_start]**Make-It-4D: Synthesizing a Consistent Long-Term Dynamic Scene Video from a Single Image:** This method generates a consistent long-term dynamic video from a single image[cite: 36, 33]. [cite_start]It addresses challenges of inconsistent perpetual views and struggles with long camera trajectories[cite: 34, 35]. [cite_start]It achieves consistency by estimating underlying 4D (3D geometry and scene motion) [cite: 35] [cite_start]using layered depth images (LDIs) to represent the scene, forming a feature point cloud[cite: 37]. [cite_start]This point cloud is displaced based on scene flow and camera pose, enabling global consistency[cite: 38, 39]. [cite_start]It also fills occluded regions using a pre-trained diffusion model for inpainting and outpainting[cite: 40, 41].
    * [cite_start]**Refinement of Monocular Depth Maps via Multi-View Differentiable Rendering:** This approach generates view-consistent and detailed depth maps from multiple posed images[cite: 45]. [cite_start]It leverages monocular depth estimation for topologically complete but metrically inaccurate depth maps, then refines them in a two-stage optimization process based on a differentiable renderer[cite: 46]. [cite_start]It scales the monocular depth map to absolute distances using structure-from-motion, transforms depths to a triangle surface mesh, and refines this mesh for photometric and geometric consistency[cite: 47, 48]. [cite_start]This results in dense, detailed, high-quality depth maps, even in challenging indoor scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches[cite: 49].
    * [cite_start]**3D reconstruction using Structure for Motion:** This model works towards 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces using stereo vision with HDR cameras, capturing textures and spatial features as 2D images, which are then used as input to an algorithm to visualize the depth map[cite: 51]. This directly contributes to creating a 3D representation and depth maps from video frames.

* Model (Inference Phase - CNAPS-like adaptation for temporal consistency):
    * [cite_start]**DepthCrafter** is explicitly designed to generate "consistent long depth sequences" for videos[cite: 32], directly solving the consistency problem.
    * [cite_start]**Make-It-4D** maintains "global consistency" of the generated dynamic video through its 4D representation (3D geometry and scene motion) derived from layered depth images and scene flow[cite: 39].
    * [cite_start]**Refinement of Monocular Depth Maps via Multi-View Differentiable Rendering** generates "view consistent" depth maps and refines them based on photometric and geometric consistency[cite: 45, 48], which is crucial for temporal smoothness across frames.
    * [cite_start]**3D reconstruction using Structure for Motion** builds a 3D visualization and depth map from sequential 2D images[cite: 51], inherently working towards temporal consistency by processing frames in a sequence.

* [cite_start]Output: A smooth depth map for every frame of the video clip, making the whole scene come alive in 3D, and maintaining consistency over time[cite: 27].
