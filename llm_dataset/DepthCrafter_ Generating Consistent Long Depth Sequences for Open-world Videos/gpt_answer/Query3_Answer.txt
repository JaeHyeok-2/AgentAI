ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"Ran it on some outdoor footage, and it still captured the depth consistentlyâ€”even with changing light and motion. How can a model handle such open-world complexity?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is testing **open-world monocular depth estimation**, aiming to understand how models perform robustly under diverse conditions like outdoor lighting, camera jitter, motion blur, and environmental complexity.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A handheld or dynamic outdoor video with environmental variation (e.g., shadows, weather, moving vehicles).  
- **Model**:  
  - **DepthCrafter** predicts long-range, temporally consistent depth with no fine-tuning using a two-stage temporal encoder and flow-guided propagation.  
  - **Test-time rescaling techniques** (e.g., from the disparity-to-depth paper) use sparse sensor depth or IMU for scaling without degrading generalization.  
  - **MegaSaM** supports depth and pose estimation under motion, noise, and minimal parallax.
- **Output**: High-resolution, robust depth predictions that remain aligned even under wild, real-world variation.

### âœ… Summary:

DepthCrafter generalizes across open-world videos using robust temporal propagation and flow alignment.  
Its strength lies in zero-shot transfer and consistency, even in wild outdoor conditions.
