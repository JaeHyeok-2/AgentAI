ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"Dropped in a regular video clip, and it created a smooth depth map for every frameâ€”like the whole scene came alive in 3D. How does it stay consistent over time like that?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is performing **monocular video depth estimation**, where a depth map is generated for every frame in a video. The key challenge lies in maintaining **temporal consistency** across frames despite motion, occlusion, or appearance changes.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A standard video clip with arbitrary scenes and camera movement.  
- **Model**:  
  - **DepthCrafter** processes long video sequences and ensures consistent depth across frames by using **depth flow estimation**, temporal attention, and self-supervised learning without the need for dense depth supervision.  
  - It captures spatial and temporal cues to maintain coherence in 3D geometry.
- **Output**: A temporally smooth depth map sequence that preserves structure and depth alignment across frames.

### âœ… Summary:

DepthCrafter solves temporal inconsistency by estimating long-range depth flow and training to align depths over time.  
It enables standard 2D videos to be reimagined as consistent 3D sequencesâ€”even in open, dynamic environments.
