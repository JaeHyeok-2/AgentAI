ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"Even when people or objects moved quickly, it kept the depth stable and accurate. What helps it handle dynamic scenes so well?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is evaluating **depth estimation in dynamic video scenes**, especially where rapid object or camera movement could typically cause depth flickering or failure. The focus here is on **robustness to scene motion and occlusion**.

---

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: Monocular video of dynamic scenes with rapid movement and complex structures.  
- **Model**:  
  - **DepthCrafter** uses frame-to-frame **depth flow estimation** and dynamic temporal fusion to predict consistent depth, even in fast-changing environments.  
  - Models like **R3D3** refine geometry and ego-motion using dense spatial-temporal constraints, and **MegaSaM** adapts deep SLAM to better handle scene deformation and motion.
- **Output**: Frame-aligned depth maps that remain structurally and temporally consistent, despite rapid scene changes.
