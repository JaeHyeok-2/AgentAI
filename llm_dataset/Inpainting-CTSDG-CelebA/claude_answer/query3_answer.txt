Based on the provided models and papers, here is the analysis of the user's question about dual modeling for maintaining both structure and texture alignment in large-area inpainting:

## 1. Task Analysis
The user is performing **large-scale image inpainting with dual structure-texture modeling** for selfie completion. This involves removing substantial portions of hair and background while maintaining both geometric structure (sharp contours) and surface properties (smooth textures) in perfect alignment throughout the restored regions.

## 2. CNAPS AI-like Workflow (Input → Model → Output)

**Input:** Selfie with large portions of hair and background removed, requiring extensive structural and textural reconstruction

**Model Processing:**
- **CTSDG (Inpainting-CTSDG-CelebA)** provides the core dual-modeling framework through:
  - Coherent semantic attention mechanism for maintaining structural consistency
  - Two-stage generation process handling both coarse structure and fine texture details
  - Specialized training on CelebA dataset for portrait-specific inpainting challenges
  - Edge-guided texture synthesis ensuring sharp contour preservation
- **Doppelgangers (Visual Disambiguation)** enhances structural understanding via:
  - Spatial distribution analysis of local keypoints and matches for structure preservation
  - Binary classification approach for distinguishing structural similarities and differences
  - Network architecture reasoning about both local texture cues and global structural patterns
  - Integration capabilities for maintaining 3D structural consistency during inpainting
- **SurfaceAug (Multimodal Ground Truth Sampling)** provides robust texture-structure alignment through:
  - Object-level transformations enabling realistic texture and structure synthesis
  - Multimodal resampling techniques for consistent appearance across different surface properties
  - State-of-the-art ground truth sampling ensuring natural texture-structure relationships
- **Point Cloud Surface Reconstruction** supports structural modeling via:
  - Surface reconstruction models trained on simulated data for geometric consistency
  - Semantic segmentation integration maintaining structural boundaries during completion
  - Data contextualization ensuring proper alignment between reconstructed structure and existing content

**Output:** Completed selfie with smooth textures and sharp contours perfectly aligned, showing seamless integration of hair and background regions with natural structural transitions

## 3. Technical Implementation for Dual Structure-Texture Modeling
The dual modeling capability stems from:
- **Two-stage processing:** CTSDG separates coarse structural generation from fine texture synthesis for optimal results
- **Coherent semantic attention:** Maintains structural consistency while allowing texture variation across different regions
- **Spatial keypoint analysis:** Doppelgangers ensures structural relationships are preserved during large-area completion
- **Multimodal resampling:** SurfaceAug provides robust texture-structure alignment through sophisticated sampling techniques
- **Edge-guided synthesis:** Sharp contour preservation through explicit edge guidance during texture generation
- **Surface reconstruction integration:** Point cloud modeling ensures geometric consistency across completed regions
