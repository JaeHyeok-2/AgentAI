Model: SDFD: Building a Versatile Synthetic Face Image Dataset with Diverse Attributes
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17255v2.pdf
Summary: AI systems rely on extensive training on large datasets to address various tasks. However, image-based systems, particularly those used for demographic attribute prediction, face significant challenges. Many current face image datasets primarily focus on demographic factors such as age, gender, and skin tone, overlooking other crucial facial attributes like hairstyle and accessories. This narrow focus limits the diversity of the data and consequently the robustness of AI systems trained on them. This work aims to address this limitation by proposing a methodology for generating synthetic face image datasets that capture a broader spectrum of facial diversity. Specifically, our approach integrates a systematic prompt formulation strategy, encompassing not only demographics and biometrics but also non-permanent traits like make-up, hairstyle, and accessories. These prompts guide a state-of-the-art text-to-image model in generating a comprehensive dataset of high-quality realistic images and can be used as an evaluation set in face analysis systems. Compared to existing datasets, our proposed dataset proves equally or more challenging in image classification tasks while being much smaller in size.

Model: FaceCom: Towards High-fidelity 3D Facial Shape Completion via Optimization and Inpainting Guidance
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02074v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/dragonylee/facecom
Summary: We propose FaceCom, a method for 3D facial shape completion, which delivers high-fidelity results for incomplete facial inputs of arbitrary forms. Unlike end-to-end shape completion methods based on point clouds or voxels, our approach relies on a mesh-based generative network that is easy to optimize, enabling it to handle shape completion for irregular facial scans. We first train a shape generator on a mixed 3D facial dataset containing 2405 identities. Based on the incomplete facial input, we fit complete faces using an optimization approach under image inpainting guidance. The completion results are refined through a post-processing step. FaceCom demonstrates the ability to effectively and naturally complete facial scan data with varying missing regions and degrees of missing areas. Our method can be used in medical prosthetic fabrication and the registration of deficient scanning data. Our experimental results demonstrate that FaceCom achieves exceptional performance in fitting and shape completion tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/dragonylee/FaceCom.git.

Model: Fuse after Align: Improving Face-Voice Association Learning via Multimodal Encoder
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09509v1.pdf
Summary: Today, there have been many achievements in learning the association between voice and face. However, most previous work models rely on cosine similarity or L2 distance to evaluate the likeness of voices and faces following contrastive learning, subsequently applied to retrieval and matching tasks. This method only considers the embeddings as high-dimensional vectors, utilizing a minimal scope of available information. This paper introduces a novel framework within an unsupervised setting for learning voice-face associations. By employing a multimodal encoder after contrastive learning and addressing the problem through binary classification, we can learn the implicit information within the embeddings in a more effective and varied manner. Furthermore, by introducing an effective pair selection method, we enhance the learning outcomes of both contrastive learning and the matching task. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results in voice-face matching, verification, and retrieval tasks, improving verification by approximately 3%, matching by about 2.5%, and retrieval by around 1.3%.
