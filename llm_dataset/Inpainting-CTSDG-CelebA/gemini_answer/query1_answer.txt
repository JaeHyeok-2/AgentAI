1. What task is the user trying to perform?

[cite_start]The user is trying to perform **image inpainting**, specifically filling in missing face and background parts in a selfie naturally after erasing someone from it[cite: 1]. This task requires the AI to synthesize new visual content that is consistent with the surrounding image, respecting both texture and structure.

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow for inpainting would involve specialized models that can adapt to synthesize complex missing regions, like faces and backgrounds, while maintaining naturalness and fidelity.

* [cite_start]Input: A selfie image with a masked (erased) region where a person was removed[cite: 1].

* Model (Core Inpainting/Generation Models):
    * **Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-QGO-PromptingReal (Stable Diffusion):** While primarily a text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion and similar generative models can be adapted for inpainting tasks. They learn a vast distribution of images, enabling them to generate realistic textures and structures to fill in masked areas, guided by the surrounding context.
    * [cite_start]**FaceCom: Towards High-fidelity 3D Facial Shape Completion via Optimization and Inpainting Guidance:** This model is specifically designed for 3D facial shape completion[cite: 6]. [cite_start]It can handle incomplete facial inputs of arbitrary forms, producing high-fidelity results[cite: 6]. [cite_start]It uses a mesh-based generative network and fits complete faces using an optimization approach under image inpainting guidance[cite: 7, 9]. [cite_start]This allows it to effectively and naturally complete facial scan data with varying missing regions[cite: 10]. [cite_start]This model would be crucial for naturally filling in missing face parts, ensuring structural accuracy[cite: 10].
    * [cite_start]**Blind Inpainting with Object-aware Discrimination for Artificial Marker Removal:** This method is a novel blind inpainting technique that automatically reconstructs visual content within corrupted regions without requiring manual mask input[cite: 16]. [cite_start]It includes a blind reconstruction network and an object-aware discriminator[cite: 17]. [cite_start]The reconstruction network predicts corrupted regions and simultaneously restores missing visual content[cite: 18]. [cite_start]The object-aware discriminator ensures that the restored images closely resemble clean ones, making markers undetectable after inpainting by leveraging a dense object detector's recognition capability[cite: 19, 20]. [cite_start]This model would be highly effective for naturally filling in both face and background parts, especially in a "blind" scenario where the exact mask might not be provided perfectly[cite: 16].
    * [cite_start]**Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing (AGAP):** This work focuses on efficient 3D editing using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)[cite: 22]. [cite_start]It learns the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation (canonical image)[cite: 23]. [cite_start]Users can customize 3D editing via 2D image processing, which implies a strong capability to understand and manipulate textures and appearances in a 3D context[cite: 23]. [cite_start]This model could contribute to naturally blending textures and appearance details in the inpainted regions of both the face and background by understanding the 3D scene[cite: 25, 26].

* [cite_start]Output: An image where the erased person is seamlessly removed, and the missing face and background parts are filled in naturally, with the wallpaper and skin blending in perfectly[cite: 1].
