ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"When I masked out part of a face, the AI filled in the missing cheek and jawline with matching skin texture. How does it understand both facial structure and skin detail to restore symmetry?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The task is **structure-aware facial inpainting**, particularly focusing on maintaining anatomical symmetry and skin realism during recovery of occluded or erased facial regions.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A face image with partial regions masked out (e.g., cheek or jaw).  
- **Model**:  
  - **Segmentation-HuggingFace-facebook-maskformer-swin-base-coco** segments semantically meaningful regions like skin, face, or accessories.
  - This guides facial region recognition and boundary preservation.
  - Downstream models (like FaceCom or text-to-image inpainting tools) use these masks to generate symmetrical inpainting by understanding layout and local features.
- **Output**: A visually symmetric and consistent inpainting that restores natural skin gradients and facial boundaries.

### âœ… Summary:

Semantic segmentation guides inpainting by defining **facial regions**, while completion models reconstruct missing content by referencing symmetry, texture, and latent priorsâ€”ensuring both **anatomical and visual consistency**.
