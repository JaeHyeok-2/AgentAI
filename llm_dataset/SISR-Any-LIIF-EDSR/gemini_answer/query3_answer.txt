1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is trying to perform **image super-resolution or detail enhancement**, specifically taking an old image and "zooming way beyond the original size" while retaining "sharp edges" and "fine detail" without visible pixels. [cite_start]This goes beyond simple upscaling and implies hallucinating plausible details. [cite: 1]

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow for extreme super-resolution would leverage models capable of generating or enhancing fine-grained features from low-resolution inputs, often by adapting vision encoders or optimizing for high-resolution output directly.

* [cite_start]Input: An old, low-resolution image. [cite: 1]

* Model (Core Super-Resolution/Enhancement Models):
    * [cite_start]**Deblur-MSSNet-GoPro (MSSNet):** While specifically a deblurring model, MSSNet contributes to overall image quality improvement, which is a component of making an image appear sharper when enlarged. [cite: 6]
    * [cite_start]**FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper:** This method is designed to "coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution." [cite: 10] This directly addresses the problem of retaining fine detail when zooming beyond original size. [cite_start]Vision Transformers (ViT), which are fundamental vision backbones, are often inflexibly low resolution (e.g., 224x224px or 378-448px for "high resolution" versions). [cite: 7, 8, 9] [cite_start]FeatSharp enhances these features, which are crucial for tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, and depth perception. [cite: 6]
    * [cite_start]**On the Effect of Image Resolution on Semantic Segmentation:** This study demonstrates that a streamlined model can "directly produc[e] high-resolution segmentations" and "match the performance of more complex systems that generate lower-resolution results" by "simplifying the network architecture." [cite: 22, 23] [cite_start]Traditional approaches often downscale inputs and then upscale low-resolution outputs, which misses finer details. [cite: 20, 21] [cite_start]This model uses a "bottom-up information propagation technique across various scales" to enhance accuracy, supporting the idea of recovering fine details at high resolution. [cite: 24]
    * [cite_start]**ImageNet-Hard: The Hardest Images Remaining from a Study of the Power of Zoom and Spatial Biases in Image Classification:** This paper discusses how image classifiers "zoom to the most discriminative region" to extract features for prediction, hypothesizing that this is a way to reach high accuracy. [cite: 13] [cite_start]It also introduces a "test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions." [cite: 16] [cite_start]This insight into "the potential of zooming" suggests methods that can effectively extract or create details at higher magnifications, supporting the user's observation of sharp edges. [cite: 16]

* [cite_start]Output: An old image resized to fill a full wall print with sharp edges and no visible pixels, retaining fine detail beyond its original size. [cite: 1]
