Based on the provided models and papers, here is the analysis of the user's question about preserving clarity when upscaling blurry portraits to poster size:

## 1. Task Analysis
The user is performing **high-scale image deblurring and super-resolution** for large format printing. This involves simultaneously removing blur from portrait images and significantly upscaling them to poster dimensions while maintaining smooth, detailed appearance that preserves facial features and textures.

## 2. CNAPS AI-like Workflow (Input → Model → Output)

**Input:** Blurry portrait image requiring deblurring and substantial upscaling to poster-size dimensions

**Model Processing:**
- **MIMO-UNet (Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur)** provides the core deblurring framework through:
  - Multi-Input Multi-Output architecture enabling simultaneous multi-scale processing
  - Rethinking of coarse-to-fine approach for single image deblurring optimization
  - Real blur dataset training providing robust performance on actual photographic blur
  - Efficient U-Net architecture specifically designed for blur removal tasks
- **FeatSharp** enhances detail preservation during upscaling via:
  - Coherent and efficient upsampling of feature maps from low-resolution encoders
  - Fine-grained detail recovery preventing loss of facial features during scaling
  - Novel method for maintaining detail sharpness while significantly increasing image dimensions
  - Effectiveness demonstration across perception tasks requiring high-fidelity detail preservation
- **High-Resolution Semantic Segmentation** supports large-scale processing through:
  - Streamlined model architecture capable of directly producing high-resolution outputs
  - Processing images at native resolution without traditional downscale-upscale approaches
  - Bottom-up information propagation technique across various scales enhancing accuracy
  - Empirically proven enhancement of segmentation accuracy for high-resolution outputs
- **Elastic-DETR Resolution Learning** provides adaptive scaling via:
  - Learnable resolution approach enabling elastic utilization of multiple image resolutions
  - Adaptive scale factor prediction based on image content for optimal processing
  - Scale loss and distribution loss functions optimizing resolution without prior knowledge
  - Flexible trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity for different scaling requirements

**Output:** Clear, detailed poster-size portrait with removed blur, smooth textures, and preserved facial features suitable for large format printing

## 3. Technical Implementation for Clarity Preservation
The clarity preservation capability stems from:
- **Multi-scale deblurring:** MIMO-UNet's architecture handles blur removal across multiple resolution scales simultaneously
- **Feature map sharpening:** FeatSharp maintains fine-grained details during the upscaling process
- **Native resolution processing:** High-resolution segmentation techniques avoid quality loss from downscale-upscale cycles
- **Adaptive scaling:** Elastic-DETR's learnable resolution optimizes processing for specific image content
- **Bottom-up propagation:** Information flow across scales ensures detail preservation at all magnification levels
