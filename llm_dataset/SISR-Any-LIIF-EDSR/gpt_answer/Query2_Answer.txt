ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I enlarged a blurry portrait to poster size, and it looked surprisingly smooth and detailed. How does AI preserve clarity even when upscaling far beyond normal resolution?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is engaging in **image deblurring + super-resolution**, restoring sharpness and perceptual detail in large-scale portrait images.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A low-res and blurry portrait image.  
- **Model**:  
  - **MIMO-UNet (Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur)** performs **multi-scale deblurring** using both input-level and output-level skip connections. It processes fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine features to restore texture and structure across scales.  
  - The model removes blur while preserving identity features and enhancing local contrast.  
- **Output**: A crisp portrait suitable for enlargement.

### âœ… Summary:

MIMO-UNet enhances **multi-scale structural detail** during deblurring, and methods like FeatSharp support clarity preservation. These models allow portraits to be upsampled to poster size with minimal visual loss.
