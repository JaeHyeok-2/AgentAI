ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I resized an old image to fill a full wall print, and the edges stayed sharp without any visible pixels. How does AI keep such fine detail when zooming way beyond the original size?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is performing **extreme image upsampling and deblurring** for large-format print, requiring edge fidelity and perceptual realism without artifacts.

---

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A low-quality or blurred image targeted for massive upscaling.  
- **Model**:  
  - **MSSNet (Deblur-MSSNet-GoPro)** applies multi-stream separation (sharp vs blurry) and spatial attention to isolate blur artifacts at different scales.  
  - It then recombines feature streams into a clean high-frequency restoration output.
- **Output**: A deblurred, enlarged image with restored edges and textures.

### âœ… Summary:

Models like **MSSNet** are built to **detect and remove blur at different spatial frequencies**, while frameworks like FeatSharp improve how features are preserved during upscalingâ€”making it possible to print wall-size images from small originals.
