  - Specialized low-light processing designed for challenging illumination conditions
  - Advanced algorithms handling extreme lighting variations between bright and dark regions
  - Natural enhancement techniques maintaining realistic appearance during improvement
  - Event-based processing enabling progressive enhancement layers
- **ALEN (Adaptive Light Enhancement Network)** enables layered processing via:
  - Dual-approach methodology for uniform and non-uniform low-light enhancement
  - Classification mechanism determining whether local or global illumination enhancement is required
  - Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization followed by targeted enhancement
  - Single-Channel Network (SCNet) and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise layer-wise illumination and color adjustment
- **AIGI-VC Quality Assessment** ensures natural appearance through:
  - AI-generated image quality assessment focusing on visual communication effectiveness
  - Coarse-grained human preference annotations and fine-grained preference descriptions
  - Evaluation of enhancement methods in preference prediction, interpretation, and reasoning
  - Quality benchmarking ensuring enhanced images maintain natural appearance and effectiveness
