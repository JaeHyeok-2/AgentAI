Based on the provided models and papers, here is the analysis of the user's question about progressive sharpening through feedback loops in mixed indoor/outdoor photography:

## 1. Task Analysis
The user is performing **HDR image enhancement with progressive refinement** for mixed lighting conditions. This involves processing photos containing both indoor and outdoor areas to achieve clear visibility in both regions through iterative feedback-based sharpening techniques.

## 2. CNAPS AI-like Workflow (Input → Model → Output)

**Input:** Photo with mixed indoor and outdoor areas requiring dynamic range enhancement and progressive sharpening

**Model Processing:**
- **FHDR (HDR-FHDR-I1)** provides the core HDR enhancement framework through:
  - High Dynamic Range processing specifically designed for mixed lighting scenarios
  - Multi-exposure fusion techniques handling extreme lighting variations between indoor and outdoor areas
  - Progressive tone mapping enabling iterative refinement of image quality
  - Advanced dynamic range compression maintaining detail in both bright and dark regions
- **Frequency Consolidation Priors (FCP)** enhances progressive sharpening via:
  - Neural implicit function sharpening with frequency domain consolidation
  - Recovery of high frequency components through data-driven mapping from low to full frequency coverage
  - Test-time self-reconstruction enabling progressive refinement through iterative frequency recovery
  - Disentangled frequency embeddings allowing generalization to unseen lighting conditions
- **FeatSharp Feature Enhancement** supports detail preservation through:
  - Coherent upsampling of feature maps while preserving fine-grained details
  - Novel method for picking up details that would otherwise be lost during processing
  - Enhancement effectiveness on core perception tasks requiring high detail fidelity
  - Agglomerative model training providing richer targets for progressive distillation
- **RAW Photo Reflection Removal** informs multi-stage processing via:
  - Base model processing at 256p followed by up-sampling model for full resolution
  - Two-stage architecture demonstrating progressive enhancement principles
  - Linear (RAW) photo processing maintaining maximum detail integrity throughout enhancement
  - Photometrically accurate processing ensuring natural appearance during progressive refinement

**Output:** Enhanced photo with perfectly clear outdoor views through windows and balanced indoor exposure achieved through progressive feedback-driven sharpening

## 3. Technical Implementation for Progressive Sharpening
The feedback loop capability stems from:
- **Multi-stage HDR processing:** FHDR employs iterative tone mapping and exposure fusion for progressive enhancement
- **Frequency domain refinement:** FCP uses test-time self-reconstruction for iterative high-frequency recovery
- **Feature map progression:** FeatSharp enables progressive detail enhancement through coherent upsampling
- **Multi-resolution processing:** RAW photo systems demonstrate two-stage progressive enhancement principles
- **Feedback-driven optimization:** Iterative refinement through frequency consolidation and dynamic range adjustment
