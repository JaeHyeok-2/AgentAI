ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"After a few seconds, a hazy indoor shot became much clearerâ€”like it went through multiple cleanup passes. Iâ€™m amazed how naturally the contrast balanced out."

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is applying **indoor image dehazing and enhancement**, where haze-like soft blur is removed and contrast is incrementally recovered without harming detail.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A hazy or low-contrast indoor photo.  
- **Model**:  
  - **DRACO-DehazeNet** performs **feedback-based dehazing** with contrastive learning. It separates haze artifacts from true detail using attention and dilated residuals.  
  - Though originally trained on natural haze, DRACO adapts to indoor use via feature separation and progressive refinement.
  - **NST-Fast Neural Style** adds perceptual stylization that can enhance contrast, texture, or fine detail layer-by-layer.  
- **Output**: A clean, high-contrast image that appears naturally refined over time.

### âœ… Summary:

The "layer-by-layer" effect is achieved by models like **DRACO**, which use contrastive attention and **feedback dehazing**, paired optionally with **style-aware refinement** to ensure clarity without artifacts.
