ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"A photo with indoor and outdoor areas came back with the view outside the window perfectly clear. I heard it refines the image in feedback loopsâ€”how does that progressive sharpening work?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is applying **HDR reconstruction and progressive sharpening**, particularly in scenes with mixed dynamic range (indoor + outdoor). The task requires enhancing details while maintaining structural integrity across contrast extremes.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: An image with overexposed or underexposed regions.  
- **Model**:  
  - **FHDR (Fast High Dynamic Range)** model improves dynamic range by using **feedback refinement blocks** that iteratively enhance low-detail regions.  
  - Models like **Frequency Consolidation Priors (FCP)** sharpen neural implicit representations by disentangling low-frequency signals and reconstructing high-frequency details during test-time.  
  - **FeatSharp** enhances feature maps extracted from vision transformers to preserve resolution and edge fidelity during restoration.  
- **Output**: A refined, HDR-enhanced image with sharper details and clearer high-contrast regions like windows.

### âœ… Summary:

The progressive HDR clarity is achieved using **feedback loops (FHDR)** and **feature sharpening priors (FCP, FeatSharp)** that refine both spatial resolution and frequency consistencyâ€”especially important in high-contrast scenes with both indoor and outdoor elements.
