ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I used AI on a photo with bright windows and dim interiors, and it brought out detail in both without looking fake. It felt like the image just improved layer by layer."

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is enhancing a **low-light, high dynamic range image**, focusing on both global and local illumination without introducing artifacts. The goal is balanced exposure enhancement across visually distinct zones.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A single image with uneven exposure.  
- **Model**:  
  - **Low-Light-Enhancer** and **ALEN** both classify local/global lighting zones and apply **multi-branch enhancement networks** accordingly.  
  - **ALEN** uses light classifiers and color estimators to selectively adjust exposure and saturation without global flattening.  
  - **AIGI-VC** measures how perceptually effective the result is, including readability and emotional clarity.  
- **Output**: A visually natural, enhanced image with contrast-preserving light balance and emotional realism.

### âœ… Summary:

Models like **ALEN** and **Low-Light-Enhancer** work by analyzing local and global exposure, using **adaptive light control and color enhancement**, yielding natural results that feel layered rather than flattened.
