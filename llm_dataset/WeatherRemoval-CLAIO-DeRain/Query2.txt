Model: AdvRain: Adversarial Raindrops to Attack Camera-based Smart Vision Systems
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01338v2.pdf
Summary: Vision-based perception modules are increasingly deployed in many applications, especially autonomous vehicles and intelligent robots. These modules are being used to acquire information about the surroundings and identify obstacles. Hence, accurate detection and classification are essential to reach appropriate decisions and take appropriate and safe actions at all times. Current studies have demonstrated that "printed adversarial attacks", known as physical adversarial attacks, can successfully mislead perception models such as object detectors and image classifiers. However, most of these physical attacks are based on noticeable and eye-catching patterns for generated perturbations making them identifiable/detectable by human eye or in test drives. In this paper, we propose a camera-based inconspicuous adversarial attack (\textbf{AdvRain}) capable of fooling camera-based perception systems over all objects of the same class. Unlike mask based fake-weather attacks that require access to the underlying computing hardware or image memory, our attack is based on emulating the effects of a natural weather condition (i.e., Raindrops) that can be printed on a translucent sticker, which is externally placed over the lens of a camera. To accomplish this, we provide an iterative process based on performing a random search aiming to identify critical positions to make sure that the performed transformation is adversarial for a target classifier. Our transformation is based on blurring predefined parts of the captured image corresponding to the areas covered by the raindrop. We achieve a drop in average model accuracy of more than $45\%$ and $40\%$ on VGG19 for ImageNet and Resnet34 for Caltech-101, respectively, using only $20$ raindrops.

Model: SemanticSpray++: A Multimodal Dataset for Autonomous Driving in Wet Surface Conditions
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09945v1.pdf
Summary: Autonomous vehicles rely on camera, LiDAR, and radar sensors to navigate the environment. Adverse weather conditions like snow, rain, and fog are known to be problematic for both camera and LiDAR-based perception systems. Currently, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of these methods due to the lack of publicly available datasets containing multimodal labeled data. To address this limitation, we propose the SemanticSpray++ dataset, which provides labels for camera, LiDAR, and radar data of highway-like scenarios in wet surface conditions. In particular, we provide 2D bounding boxes for the camera image, 3D bounding boxes for the LiDAR point cloud, and semantic labels for the radar targets. By labeling all three sensor modalities, the SemanticSpray++ dataset offers a comprehensive test bed for analyzing the performance of different perception methods when vehicles travel on wet surface conditions. Together with comprehensive label statistics, we also evaluate multiple baseline methods across different tasks and analyze their performances. The dataset will be available at https://semantic-spray-dataset.github.io .

Model: Sit Back and Relax: Learning to Drive Incrementally in All Weather Conditions
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18953v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/jmiemirza/dilam
Summary: In autonomous driving scenarios, current object detection models show strong performance when tested in clear weather. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when tested in degrading weather conditions. In addition, even when adapted to perform robustly in a sequence of different weather conditions, they are often unable to perform well in all of them and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To efficiently mitigate forgetting, we propose Domain-Incremental Learning through Activation Matching (DILAM), which employs unsupervised feature alignment to adapt only the affine parameters of a clear weather pre-trained network to different weather conditions. We propose to store these affine parameters as a memory bank for each weather condition and plug-in their weather-specific parameters during driving (i.e. test time) when the respective weather conditions are encountered. Our memory bank is extremely lightweight, since affine parameters account for less than 2% of a typical object detector. Furthermore, contrary to previous domain-incremental learning approaches, we do not require the weather label when testing and propose to automatically infer the weather condition by a majority voting linear classifier.
