Based on the provided models and papers, here is the analysis of the user's question about separating falling rain from background textures while maintaining building sharpness:

## 1. Task Analysis
The user is performing **selective rain streak removal with background preservation** for rainy window photography. This involves detecting and removing rain streaks and water droplets from window surfaces while maintaining the sharpness and detail of background architecture and textures.

## 2. CNAPS AI-like Workflow (Input → Model → Output)

**Input:** Photo taken through rainy window with rain streaks obscuring background buildings and architectural details

**Model Processing:**
- **CLAIO-DeRain (WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeRain)** provides comprehensive rain removal through:
  - All-in-one weather removal architecture specifically designed for rain streak detection and elimination
  - Multi-scale rain pattern analysis enabling separation of rain effects from background textures
  - Selective processing that preserves background sharpness while removing foreground rain interference
  - Specialized handling of window-based photography where rain appears as overlaid streaks
- **CoIC (Context-based Instance-level Modulation)** enhances rain-background separation via:
  - Joint rain-/detail-aware representations encapsulating both rain and background components
  - Context-based Instance-level Modulation mechanism efficiently modulating models for specific rain patterns
  - Rain-/detail-aware contrastive learning strategy extracting joint representations for precise separation
  - Meaningful representations providing instructive guidance for distinguishing rain from background textures
- **AdvRain Analysis** informs rain pattern understanding through:
  - Study of raindrop effects on camera-based perception systems providing insights into rain detection
  - Iterative processes for identifying critical raindrop positions and their visual impact
  - Transformation analysis based on blurring predefined areas corresponding to raindrop coverage
  - Understanding of how raindrops affect captured images differently from background elements
- **Two-Stage Adverse Weather Segmentation** supports robust processing via:
  - Low-rank video deraining methods generating high-fidelity pseudo ground truths
  - Superior alignment facilitating model convergence during training on rain-affected imagery
  - Robust framework designed for degraded data captured under adverse weather conditions
  - Segmentation approaches maintaining background detail while removing weather interference

**Output:** Clear photo with removed rain streaks while preserving sharp background buildings and architectural textures

## 3. Technical Implementation for Rain-Background Separation
The separation capability stems from:
- **Multi-scale pattern analysis:** CLAIO's architecture distinguishes rain patterns from background textures across different scales
- **Contrastive representation learning:** CoIC's approach creates distinct feature representations for rain and background elements
- **Context-aware modulation:** Instance-level modulation adapts processing based on specific rain and background contexts
- **Adversarial insights:** AdvRain analysis provides understanding of raindrop visual effects vs. scene content
- **Pseudo ground truth training:** Two-stage processing ensures robust rain removal while preserving background fidelity
