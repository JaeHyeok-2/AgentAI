1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is trying to perform **image deraining**, specifically removing rain streaks from a photo while preserving the sharpness and detail of the background. The core task is to effectively distinguish and separate rain components from background textures.

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow for deraining would leverage models that can understand and disentangle rain and background features, often through advanced representation learning and modulation mechanisms, to handle diverse rain types and background complexities.

* Input: A rainy window photo.

* Model (Core Deraining Models):
    * [cite_start]**WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeRain:** This model is a recommended AI model for weather removal, including deraining[cite: 6].
    * **Harnessing Joint Rain-/Detail-aware Representations to Eliminate Intricate Rains (CoIC):** This model directly addresses the challenge of distinguishing rain from background. [cite_start]It focuses on addressing various rainy images by delving into "meaningful representations that encapsulate both the rain and background components"[cite: 8]. [cite_start]It leverages these representations as "instructive guidance" [cite: 9] [cite_start]and employs a "Context-based Instance-level Modulation (CoI-M) mechanism" [cite: 9] [cite_start]to efficiently modulate CNN- or Transformer-based models[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Furthermore, it devises a "rain-/detail-aware contrastive learning strategy to help extract joint rain-/detail-aware representations"[cite: 10]. [cite_start]CoIC is an "innovative and potent algorithm tailored for training models on mixed datasets" [cite: 11] [cite_start]and "enhances the deraining prowess remarkably when real-world dataset is included"[cite: 14].

* Model (Related Concepts for Robustness/Attacks):
    * [cite_start]**AdvRain: Adversarial Raindrops to Attack Camera-based Smart Vision Systems:** This paper focuses on creating adversarial attacks by emulating raindrops[cite: 21]. [cite_start]The attack is based on "blurring predefined parts of the captured image corresponding to the areas covered by the raindrop"[cite: 23]. While it describes an attack, understanding how an adversarial "raindrop" blurs specific areas can provide insights into how a deraining model might conversely identify and remove such blurred rain features while preserving unblurred background. [cite_start]It highlights the distinct spatial patterns of raindrops[cite: 23].
    * [cite_start]**A Two-Stage Adverse Weather Semantic Segmentation Method for WeatherProof Challenge CVPR 2024 Workshop UG2+:** This framework uses a "low-rank video deraining method to generate high-fidelity pseudo ground truths" [cite: 28] in its first stage. [cite_start]These pseudo ground truths "offer superior alignment compared to the original ground truths, facilitating model convergence during training"[cite: 29]. [cite_start]This approach demonstrates robustness to "degraded data captured under adverse weather conditions"[cite: 31]. The ability to create "high-fidelity pseudo ground truths" through deraining implies a sophisticated mechanism for separating rain from actual scene content to generate a clean reference.

* Output: The rain streaks vanish instantly, and the building behind stays sharp, achieved by models that effectively separate falling rain from background textures through learned representations and specific modulation mechanisms.
