ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"In a photo taken through a wet windshield, AI removed all the heavy streaks without blurring the scene. What kind of spatial cues or patterns help it detect rain lines so effectively?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is applying **rain-streak removal under occlusion**, where the goal is to eliminate structured streaks (like those on glass) without affecting the visual integrity of the background.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A rainy photo with overlaid streaks or blobs, especially from windshield interference.  
- **Model**:  
  - **CLAIO-DeRain** analyzes local gradients and motion-invariant streak geometry to segment vertical and diagonal streaks.  
  - Models like **AdvRain** simulate streak formations and use adversarial priors to teach models to focus on what makes rain spatially distinct.  
- **Output**: A high-contrast, blur-free image with well-preserved structural contours and no rain streaks.

### âœ… Summary:

Rain detection in deraining models is enabled by learning **spatial streak continuity**, **directionality**, and **local blur frequency contrast**â€”features that distinguish rain from static image content.
