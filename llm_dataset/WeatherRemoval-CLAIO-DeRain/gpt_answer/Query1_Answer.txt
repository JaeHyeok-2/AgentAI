ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I ran a rainy window photo through the AI and the streaks vanished instantly, while the building behind stayed sharp. How does the model separate falling rain from background textures?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is performing **image deraining**, aiming to remove rain streaks while preserving scene structure and background details. This requires fine-grained separation of transient noise (rain) from stable features.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A photo degraded by rain streaks overlaying a textured background.  
- **Model**:  
  - **CLAIO-DeRain** learns spatial and frequency cues from rain streak patterns, separating transient high-frequency artifacts (like linear streaks) from consistent background edges.  
  - It utilizes feature enhancement and residual learning to preserve edges and avoid flattening the scene.  
- **Output**: A clean image with rain streaks removed and background clarity intact.

### âœ… Summary:

Derain models like CLAIO detect **statistical and geometric patterns of rain** using residual priors and modulated attention, allowing background textures to remain sharp while selectively removing streaks.
