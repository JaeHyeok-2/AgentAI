ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I tested it on diagrams from old research papers, and it correctly matched them with the right medical terms. How can it connect visuals and scientific language like that?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is exploring **multimodal medical concept grounding**, where diagrams or visual structures from research papers are linked with precise biomedical terminology. This task combines computer vision and natural language processing, specifically **biomedical visual-language alignment**.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

#### **Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**

- **Input**: A diagram extracted from a research paper (e.g., histopathology, molecular structure, or radiology schematic).
- **Model**:  
  - **BiomedCLIP** is a vision-language model pretrained on 15 million imageâ€“text pairs from biomedical sources. It aligns visual embeddings from images (like diagrams) with semantic representations of text (PubMed biomedical terminology).
  - The userâ€™s diagram is embedded into a shared latent space alongside medical terms. The model retrieves or matches the most semantically similar termsâ€”even in zero-shot settingsâ€”based on cosine similarity in that embedding space.
- **Output**: The diagram is matched with correct biomedical terms or categories based on learned visual-linguistic associations.

### âœ… Summary:

BiomedCLIP and related models build a shared embedding space between visual and textual medical data.  
Thanks to this pretraining, when the user inputs a visual diagramâ€”even from older literatureâ€”the model can **immediately align it with modern, domain-specific terminology** without needing task-specific training.

This is made possible through:
- large-scale multimodal pretraining,
- contrastive learning,
- knowledge-injected embedding spaces,
- and versatile visual grounding architectures.
