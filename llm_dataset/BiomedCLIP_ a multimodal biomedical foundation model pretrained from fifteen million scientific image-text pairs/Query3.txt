Summary: Is self-supervised deep learning (DL) for medical image analysis already a serious alternative to the de facto standard of end-to-end trained supervised DL? We tackle this question for medical image classification, with a particular focus on one of the currently most limiting factors of the field: the (non-)availability of labeled data. Based on three common medical imaging modalities (bone marrow microscopy, gastrointestinal endoscopy, dermoscopy) and publicly available data sets, we analyze the performance of self-supervised DL within the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) framework. After learning an image representation without use of image labels, conventional machine learning classifiers are applied. The classifiers are fit using a systematically varied number of labeled data (1-1000 samples per class). Exploiting the learned image representation, we achieve state-of-the-art classification performance for all three imaging modalities and data sets with only a fraction of between 1% and 10% of the available labeled data and about 100 labeled samples per class.

Model: TransMed: Large Language Models Enhance Vision Transformer for Biomedical Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.07125v2.pdf
Summary: Few-shot learning has been studied to adapt models to tasks with very few samples. It holds profound significance, particularly in clinical tasks, due to the high annotation cost of medical images. Several works have explored few-shot learning on medical images, yet they still require a large number of medical images for pre-training models to gain domain-specific priors. Vision foundation models recently have achieved remarkable success in natural images. Hence, adapting rapidly advancing vision foundation models from natural images to few-shot clinical tasks holds great promise. MedFMC has recently organized a challenge to shed more light on this topic at NeurIPS 2023. In this work, we present our challenge solution. We observe that a simple variant of fine-tuning with partial freezing shows remarkable performance. Empirical evidence demonstrates that this approach could outperform various common fine-tuning methods under limited sample sizes. Additionally, we explore enhanced utilization of semantic supervision to boost performance. We propose a novel approach that contextualizes labels via large language models (LLMs). Our findings reveal that the context generated by LLMs significantly enhances the discrimination of semantic embeddings for similar categories, resulting in a notable performance improvement of 3%-5% in 1-shot settings compared to commonly employed one-hot labels and other semantic supervision methods. Our solution secures the 1st place in the MedFMC challenge.

Model: Data AUDIT: Identifying Attribute Utility- and Detectability-Induced Bias in Task Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03218v1.pdf
Summary: To safely deploy deep learning-based computer vision models for computer-aided detection and diagnosis, we must ensure that they are robust and reliable. Towards that goal, algorithmic auditing has received substantial attention. To guide their audit procedures, existing methods rely on heuristic approaches or high-level objectives (e.g., non-discrimination in regards to protected attributes, such as sex, gender, or race). However, algorithms may show bias with respect to various attributes beyond the more obvious ones, and integrity issues related to these more subtle attributes can have serious consequences. To enable the generation of actionable, data-driven hypotheses which identify specific dataset attributes likely to induce model bias, we contribute a first technique for the rigorous, quantitative screening of medical image datasets. Drawing from literature in the causal inference and information theory domains, our procedure decomposes the risks associated with dataset attributes in terms of their detectability and utility (defined as the amount of information knowing the attribute gives about a task label). To demonstrate the effectiveness and sensitivity of our method, we develop a variety of datasets with synthetically inserted artifacts with different degrees of association to the target label that allow evaluation of inherited model biases via comparison of performance against true counterfactual examples. Using these datasets and results from hundreds of trained models, we show our screening method reliably identifies nearly imperceptible bias-inducing artifacts. Lastly, we apply our method to the natural attributes of a popular skin-lesion dataset and demonstrate its success. Our approach provides a means to perform more systematic algorithmic audits and guide future data collection efforts in pursuit of safer and more reliable models.
