Based on the provided models and papers, here is the analysis of the user's question about unsupervised medical image grouping by condition:

## 1. Task Analysis
The user is performing **unsupervised medical image clustering** or **self-supervised representation learning** for condition-based grouping. This involves automatically organizing X-ray and pathology scans into meaningful categories based on underlying medical conditions without requiring labeled training data.

## 2. CNAPS AI-like Workflow (Input → Model → Output)

**Input:** Mixed collection of X-ray and pathology scans without condition labels

**Model Processing:**
- **BiomedCLIP** provides foundational multimodal representations by:
  - Extracting rich visual features from medical images using vision transformer architecture
  - Leveraging pretraining on 15 million scientific image-text pairs for robust medical domain understanding
  - Creating embeddings that capture clinical similarities across different imaging modalities
- **DINO (Self-Distillation with No Labels) framework** enables unsupervised learning by:
  - Learning image representations without using any labels
  - Applying self-supervised objectives to discover inherent patterns in medical images
  - Generating feature vectors that naturally cluster by medical condition
- **TransMed approach** enhances classification through:
  - Utilizing vision foundation models adapted for medical imaging
  - Applying few-shot learning principles for efficient adaptation
  - Contextualizing semantic information via large language models

**Output:** Automatically grouped image clusters organized by medical conditions (e.g., pneumonia cases, fractures, normal scans, specific pathological patterns)

## 3. Technical Implementation
The unsupervised grouping capability stems from:
- **Self-supervised pretraining:** DINO framework learns discriminative features by comparing different augmented views of the same image
- **Domain-specific embeddings:** BiomedCLIP creates medically meaningful representations that naturally separate different conditions
- **Clustering algorithms:** Once feature representations are learned, conventional machine learning classifiers can identify condition-based groupings
- **Multi-modal foundation:** Large-scale pretraining across diverse medical images enables generalization across X-ray and pathology domains
