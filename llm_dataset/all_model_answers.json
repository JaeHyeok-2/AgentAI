[cite_start]They uploaded a microscope image, and it instantly told them what kind of cells they were‚Äîwithout any extra training[cite: 1].

In this scenario, the model would likely leverage self-supervised pre-training to quickly identify cell types. Here's how the recommended models could fit into such a workflow:\n\n* **Input:** The user uploads a microscope image containing various cells. [cite_start]This image serves as the input to the pre-trained model[cite: 1].\n\n* **Model (Pre-training Phase - Self-Supervised Learning):**\n    * [cite_start]**\"Self-supervised pseudo-colorizing of masked cells\" model:** This work introduces a novel self-supervision objective for the analysis of cells in biomedical microscopy images[cite: 7]. [cite_start]It proposes training deep learning models to pseudo-colorize masked cells[cite: 8]. [cite_start]It uses a physics-informed pseudo-spectral colormap that is well suited for colorizing cell topology[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Experiments reveal that approximating semantic segmentation by pseudo-colorization is beneficial for subsequent fine-tuning on cell detection[cite: 10]. [cite_start]Inspired by the recent success of masked image modeling, it additionally masks out cell parts and trains to reconstruct these parts to further enrich the learned representations[cite: 11]. [cite_start]This pre-training method can outperform SimCLR, MAE-like masked image modeling, and edge-based self-supervision when pre-training on a diverse set of six fluorescence microscopy datasets[cite: 14].

[cite_start]Experimentation with varying model complexities and receptive field sizes reveals the remarkable phenomenon that fine-tuned models of lower complexity consistently outperform more complex models with random weight initialization[cite: 22].

      "llm_B": "Here's the answer to your prompt in TXT format:\n\n```\n1. What task is the user trying to perform?\n\n[cite_start]The user is trying to perform an unsupervised clustering or classification task on medical images (X-ray and pathology scans)[cite: 29]. [cite_start]The goal is to group these images by medical condition without the need for pre-existing labels[cite: 29]. This is a form of unsupervised learning, specifically related to learning meaningful representations from medical images that allow for inherent grouping based on underlying conditions.\n\n2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input ‚Üí model ‚Üí output).\n\nA CNAPS AI-like workflow emphasizes rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited or no labeled data. In this scenario, the models would leverage self-supervised learning and pre-trained foundational knowledge to sort medical images without supervision.\n\n* [cite_start]Input: Unlabeled X-ray and pathology scans (medical images)[cite: 29].\n\n* Model (Pre-training Phase - Self-Supervised/Foundation Models):\n    * [cite_start]BiomedCLIP: a multimodal biomedical foundation model pretrained from fifteen million scientific image-text pairs[cite: 34]. While its primary focus is multimodal alignment, the representations learned from this vast dataset are foundational and can capture rich visual features from biomedical images, which are crucial for subsequent unsupervised tasks.\n    * [cite_start]Self-supervision for medical image classification (using DINO framework): This approach directly addresses unsupervised learning for medical images[cite: 36]. [cite_start]It learns an image representation without the use of image labels[cite: 37]. [cite_start]After this self-supervised learning, conventional machine learning classifiers can be applied, fitted using a systematically varied (but typically small) number of labeled data[cite: 38]. [cite_start]This method has achieved state-of-the-art classification performance with only a fraction of available labeled data (e.g., ~100 labeled samples per class)[cite: 39]. This shows its ability to learn powerful representations from unlabeled data.\n    * [cite_start]TransMed (Large Language Models Enhance Vision Transformer for Biomedical Image Classification): This work explores few-shot learning, which is highly relevant when annotated data is scarce, as in unsupervised scenarios[cite: 40, 41]. [cite_start]It adapts rapidly advancing vision foundation models from natural images to few-shot clinical tasks[cite: 44]. [cite_start]A novel approach is proposed that contextualizes labels via large language models (LLMs), which significantly enhances the discrimination of semantic embeddings for similar categories[cite: 49, 50]. Although primarily for classification, the enhanced semantic understanding gained through LLMs could aid in forming more coherent clusters in an unsupervised setting by improving the inherent representation of different conditions.\n    * [cite_start]Data AUDIT: Identifying Attribute Utility- and Detectability-Induced Bias in Task Models: While this model's primary goal is to identify bias in datasets [cite: 52, 55][cite_start], its underlying process of rigorously screening medical image datasets [cite: 55] [cite_start]and decomposing risks based on attribute detectability and utility [cite: 56] implies a deep understanding and representation of image attributes. This foundational understanding of image features could implicitly contribute to or inform unsupervised grouping by helping to discern meaningful differences between image categories, even without explicit labels.\n\n* Model (Inference Phase - CNAPS-like adaptation for unsupervised grouping):\n    * [cite_start]The core mechanism for sorting without labels comes from the **self-supervised learning** inherent in the \"Self-supervision for medical image classification\" model, which learns a robust image representation without labels[cite: 37]. This representation allows for images of similar conditions to be close to each other in the learned feature space.\n    * [cite_start]**BiomedCLIP**'s pre-trained ability to understand biomedical images provides a rich feature space that facilitates the grouping of visually similar conditions, even without explicit supervision[cite: 34].\n    * [cite_start]The semantic understanding enhanced by LLMs in **TransMed** could contribute to creating a more semantically meaningful embedding space where images of the same condition naturally cluster together[cite: 49, 50].\n    * [cite_start]While **Data AUDIT** focuses on bias, its ability to analyze and quantify attributes within datasets suggests an underlying mechanism for discerning various image characteristics, which is a prerequisite for effective unsupervised grouping[cite: 56].\n\n* [cite_start]Output: The system groups the X-ray and pathology scans by condition without requiring labels[cite: 29].\n\n3.

While its primary role is interpretation, its ability to deeply understand visual concepts within a model's latent space implies that the model can effectively process and manipulate these concepts (like \"elegance\" or \"curve of the legs\") to generate precise visual outputs.

This directly supports how the system can understand design features from words. [cite_start]It describes fine-tuned LLMs like MechGPT that gain \"reasonable understanding of domain knowledge\"[cite: 9, 10].

How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input ‚Üí model ‚Üí output).\n\nA CNAPS AI-like workflow for cleaning up messy prompts would involve models that can robustly interpret user intent from noisy textual input, learn from unlabeled data to refine understanding, and evaluate the alignment between prompt content and generated images.\n\n* [cite_start]Input: A jumbled or messy text prompt (e.g., \"jumbled words in my prompt\")[cite: 1].\n\n* Model (Core Text-to-Image Generation Model):\n    * [cite_start]**Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-QGO-PromptingReal:** This model is a text-to-image model that takes a textual prompt and generates an image[cite: 6]. This model would be responsible for the actual image generation based on its interpretation of the messy prompt.\n\n* Model (Related Concepts for Prompt Cleaning/Understanding):\n    * **POUF: Prompt-oriented unsupervised fine-tuning for large pre-trained models:** This framework directly addresses how AI handles messy or jumbled prompts. [cite_start]It proposes an \"unsupervised fine-tuning framework to directly fine-tune the model or prompt on the unlabeled target data\"[cite: 8]. [cite_start]This allows large pre-trained models, which are expressive and powerful [cite: 6][cite_start], to adapt to downstream tasks even when labeled data is a critical limitation[cite: 7, 8]. [cite_start]POUF works by \"aligning the discrete distributions extracted from the prompts and target data\" [cite: 9][cite_start], enabling the model to learn what the user \"really want[s]\" [cite: 1] from messy inputs. [cite_start]It has achieved \"consistent improvements over the baselines\" across various tasks, including image classification[cite: 10, 11], indicating its effectiveness in cleaning up prompts.\n    * [cite_start]**TIAM -- A Metric for Evaluating Alignment in Text-to-Image Generation:** This metric is crucial for understanding how AI \"cleans up a messy prompt\" [cite: 1] [cite_start]by evaluating the alignment between the \"content specified in the prompt and the corresponding generated images\"[cite: 15]. [cite_start]TIAM can \"better characterize the alignment in terms of the type of the specified objects, their number, and their color\"[cite: 16]. [cite_start]It also quantifies \"the influence of the number of concepts in the prompt, their order as well as their (color) attributes\"[cite: 19]. By doing so, it provides insights into how well the T2I model understands the essential content of the prompt, even when jumbled. [cite_start]The metric reveals that image quality can vary drastically depending on the noise used as a seed[cite: 18], which also influences how the model interprets and generates from a messy prompt.\n    * [cite_start]**Multi-Turn Multi-Modal Question Clarification for Enhanced Conversational Understanding:** This task and proposed framework, Mario, directly address refining \"complex user preferences\" [cite: 22] [cite_start]over multiple turns of interaction using both text and visual modalities[cite: 24]. [cite_start]While the user's prompt is a single input, the underlying principle of \"progressive refinement for complex queries\" [cite: 28] [cite_start]through \"integrat[ing] textual and visual information from conversational history\" [cite: 26] demonstrates how an AI system can effectively understand and clarify ambiguous or messy user intent by leveraging context and multimodal cues, even if that \"context\" is internal to how the model processes a prompt. [cite_start]This framework's gains are \"most significant in longer interactions\"[cite: 28], suggesting its ability to handle progressively more complex or messy inputs.\n\n* [cite_start]Output: A correctly generated portrait, despite a messy prompt[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The AI cleans up the prompt by using unsupervised fine-tuning to align prompt and target data distributions [cite: 8, 9][cite_start], quantifying the influence of concept order and attributes [cite: 19][cite_start], and leveraging multi-modal clarification approaches to progressively refine user intent[cite: 24, 28].\n\n3.
