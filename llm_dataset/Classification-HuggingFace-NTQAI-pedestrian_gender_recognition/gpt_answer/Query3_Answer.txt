🧠 User Question:
"How do AI models today achieve accurate gender recognition, and what steps are usually taken during training to ensure fairness and avoid biases related to ethnicity, clothing, or camera angles?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?
This is a **retail or demographic analytics application** for gender classification from camera feeds, with emphasis on ethical fairness and demographic bias mitigation.

---

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input → Model → Output**  
- **Input**: RGB video/image from indoor or outdoor camera feeds.  
- **Model**:  
  - Classification models like **Classification-HuggingFace-NTQAI-pedestrian_gender_recognition** are trained on demographically diverse pedestrian datasets.  
  - Multimodal fairness techniques combine **visual + text + metadata** to reduce bias.  
  - Fairness audits are done using **benchmarks like UTKFace, FACET**, and others.  
- **Output**: Gender classification with improved bias mitigation.
