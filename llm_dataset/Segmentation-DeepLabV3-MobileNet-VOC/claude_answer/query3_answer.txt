  - Pre-trained MobileNetv3-Large backbones for efficient feature extraction
  - Fusible modules and enhanced deep training strategy for optimal performance
  - Re-parametrization during inference significantly reducing parameter count and computational overhead
  - Deployment mode switching for real-time performance optimization
- **PP-MobileSeg** achieves state-of-the-art mobile performance through:
  - StrideFormer backbone built with MV3 blocks and strided SEA attention
  - Aggregated Attention Module (AAM) filtering detailed features through semantic ensemble voting
  - Valid Interpolate Module (VIM) reducing latency by only interpolating present classes
  - 32.9% fewer parameters and 42.3% faster acceleration compared to baseline methods
- **TraceNet** provides efficient single-instance segmentation via:
  - Receptive field tracing explicitly locating selected instances
  - Computation only on selected image regions reducing overall cost and memory consumption
  - User-tap driven segmentation minimizing unnecessary processing
  - Joint achievement of efficiency and interactivity for mobile inference

**Output:** Real-time segmentation results with smooth performance even on older mobile devices while maintaining acceptable accuracy
