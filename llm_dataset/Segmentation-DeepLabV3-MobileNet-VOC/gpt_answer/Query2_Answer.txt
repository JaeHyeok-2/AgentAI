ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"When I tried changing backgrounds in photos, the AI accurately detected body outlinesâ€”even messy hair. What kind of models can handle such fine-grained segmentation?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is exploring **high-resolution semantic segmentation**, particularly focused on **fine-grained boundaries** like hair, fingers, or accessoriesâ€”tasks requiring detailed edge precision.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: An image with soft, complex object boundaries.
- **Model**:  
  - **Segmentation-DeepLabV3-MobileNet-VOC** handles semantic segmentation using multiscale contextual features.  
  - Enhanced with fine-grained tuning or guided by auto-prompting (e.g., via Segment Any Cell frameworks), it can improve precision around fuzzy regions like hair.
- **Output**: A mask that captures clean object boundaries and internal regions, even in visually ambiguous zones.
