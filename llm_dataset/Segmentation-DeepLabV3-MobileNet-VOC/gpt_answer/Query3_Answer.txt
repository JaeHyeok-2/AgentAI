ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"The app ran smoothly even on my older phone. What makes segmentation models lightweight enough for real-time use on low-power devices?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is deploying **real-time semantic segmentation** on **edge devices** (e.g., smartphones), emphasizing speed, memory efficiency, and responsiveness.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A video or photo captured on a mobile device.
- **Model**:  
  - **DeepLabV3-MobileNet** leverages a **depthwise separable convolutional encoder** (MobileNet) and a fast **ASPP decoder**.
  - Compared to transformer-heavy backbones, this significantly reduces parameter count and FLOPs while maintaining accuracy.
- **Output**: A real-time segmentation map usable for background blur, AR masks, or object overlays.
