ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I used a mobile app that instantly separated people from backgrounds, even in crowded scenes. How can AI figure out whatâ€™s a person and whatâ€™s the background so quickly?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is performing **real-time semantic segmentation**, specifically person-background separation in cluttered scenesâ€”such as removing the background behind people in selfies or video calls.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: An RGB image with multiple people and complex background.
- **Model**:  
  - **Segmentation-DeepLabV3-MobileNet-VOC** uses a lightweight MobileNet encoder with DeepLabV3â€™s atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) for multiscale context extraction.
  - It rapidly identifies person regions by detecting patterns aligned with pre-learned body part features.
- **Output**: A per-pixel class label map where each pixel is marked as "person" or "background".
