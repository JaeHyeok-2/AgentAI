Model: Beyond Positive History: Re-ranking with List-level Hybrid Feedback
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20778v1.pdf
Summary: As the last stage of recommender systems, re-ranking generates a re-ordered list that aligns with the user's preference. However, previous works generally focus on item-level positive feedback as history (e.g., only clicked items) and ignore that users provide positive or negative feedback on items in the entire list. This list-level hybrid feedback can reveal users' holistic preferences and reflect users' comparison behavior patterns manifesting within a list. Such patterns could predict user behaviors on candidate lists, thus aiding better re-ranking. Despite appealing benefits, extracting and integrating preferences and behavior patterns from list-level hybrid feedback into re-ranking multiple items remains challenging. To this end, we propose Re-ranking with List-level Hybrid Feedback (dubbed RELIFE). It captures user's preferences and behavior patterns with three modules: a Disentangled Interest Miner to disentangle the user's preferences into interests and disinterests, a Sequential Preference Mixer to learn users' entangled preferences considering the context of feedback, and a Comparison-aware Pattern Extractor to capture user's behavior patterns within each list. Moreover, for better integration of patterns, contrastive learning is adopted to align the behavior patterns of candidate and historical lists. Extensive experiments show that RELIFE significantly outperforms SOTA re-ranking baselines.

Model: Conversational Question Answering with Reformulations over Knowledge Graph
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17269v2.pdf
Summary: Conversational question answering (convQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) involves answering multi-turn natural language questions about information contained in a KG. State-of-the-art methods of ConvQA often struggle with inexplicit question-answer pairs. These inputs are easy for human beings to understand given a conversation history, but hard for a machine to interpret, which can degrade ConvQA performance. To address this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based model, CornNet, which utilizes question reformulations generated by large language models (LLMs) to improve ConvQA performance. CornNet adopts a teacher-student architecture where a teacher model learns question representations using human writing reformulations, and a student model to mimic the teacher model's output via reformulations generated by LLMs. The learned question representation is then used by an RL model to locate the correct answer in a KG. Extensive experimental results show that CornNet outperforms state-of-the-art convQA models.

Model: Personalized Top-k Set Queries Over Predicted Scores
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12998v1.pdf
Summary: This work studies the applicability of expensive external oracles such as large language models in answering top-k queries over predicted scores. Such scores are incurred by user-defined functions to answer personalized queries over multi-modal data. We propose a generic computational framework that handles arbitrary set-based scoring functions, as long as the functions could be decomposed into constructs, each of which sent to an oracle (in our case an LLM) to predict partial scores. At a given point in time, the framework assumes a set of responses and their partial predicted scores, and it maintains a collection of possible sets that are likely to be the true top-k. Since calling oracles is costly, our framework judiciously identifies the next construct, i.e., the next best question to ask the oracle so as to maximize the likelihood of identifying the true top-k. We present a principled probabilistic model that quantifies that likelihood. We study efficiency opportunities in designing algorithms. We run an evaluation with three large scale datasets, scoring functions, and baselines. Experiments indicate the efficacy of our framework, as it achieves an order of magnitude improvement over baselines in requiring LLM calls while ensuring result accuracy. Scalability experiments further indicate that our framework could be used in large-scale applications.
