ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I ran it on X-ray and pathology scans, and it grouped them by condition without labels. What kind of model can sort medical images with no supervision?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is performing **unsupervised medical image clustering or representation learning**, where medical scans (like X-rays or pathology slides) are grouped based on shared underlying patterns, such as disease type or severityâ€”**without the use of labels**. This points to **self-supervised representation learning** as the core method.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

#### **Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**

- **Input**: A set of unlabeled medical images from modalities such as X-rays or pathology scans.
- **Model**:  
  - **BiomedCLIP** generates joint image-text embeddings via large-scale pretraining on 15 million image-text biomedical pairs. Even without explicit labels, the visual encoder can project image content into a semantically rich space that reflects disease categories learned during training.
  - Models like **Sparsam (DINO)** leverage **self-supervised contrastive learning**, where the model learns by predicting variations of the same image. These embeddings allow clustering of similar conditions even without supervision.
- **Output**: Embedding vectors for each image that cluster naturally by condition. The result is unsupervised grouping of images into semantically meaningful categories.

### âœ… Summary:

The model is able to cluster medical images without labels by leveraging **self-supervised or contrastive learning** methods like DINO, or pretrained vision-language models like **BiomedCLIP**. These techniques allow models to form meaningful visual representations, leading to **label-free grouping** based on condition similarityâ€”enabling robust unsupervised medical analysis.
