1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is trying to perform **image dehazing or atmospheric turbulence removal**. They observed that a hazy mountain photo became sharp and clear, indicating a process that removes atmospheric degradation and restores obscured details.

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow for dehazing emphasizes efficient and effective restoration, especially with limited data, and tailoring enhancements to specific scene contexts.

* [cite_start]Input: A hazy mountain photo. [cite: 1]

* Model (Core Dehazing Models):
    * [cite_start]**WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze:** This model is a recommended AI model for weather removal, including dehazing. [cite: 6]
    * [cite_start]**DRACO-DehazeNet: An Efficient Image Dehazing Network Combining Detail Recovery and a Novel Contrastive Learning Paradigm:** This model is designed for efficient and effective image dehazing. [cite: 8] [cite_start]It features a dense dilated inverted residual block and an attention-based detail recovery network that tailors enhancements to specific dehazed scene contexts. [cite: 8] [cite_start]A key innovation is its ability to train effectively with limited data through a novel quadruplet loss-based contrastive dehazing paradigm. [cite: 9] [cite_start]This approach distinguishes hazy and clear image features, as well as lower-quality and higher-quality dehazed images from sub-modules, refining the dehazing process. [cite: 10]

* Model (Related Concepts for Quality/Efficiency):
    * [cite_start]**Quality Assured: Rethinking Annotation Strategies in Imaging AI:** While not a dehazing model, this paper studies generating high-quality reference annotations [cite: 14][cite_start], which are essential for reliable benchmarking and application of AI-based image analysis. [cite: 14] [cite_start]Understanding how to maximize data annotation efficacy [cite: 17] could indirectly help in training dehazing models by providing better ground truth data, especially when dealing with varied haze conditions.

* [cite_start]Output: The distant peaks in the hazy mountain photo become sharp and clear, with obscured parts naturally restored. [cite: 1]
