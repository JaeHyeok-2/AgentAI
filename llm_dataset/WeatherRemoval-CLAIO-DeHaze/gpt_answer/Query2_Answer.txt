ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"In an old photo taken on a misty morning, the AI removed the grey fog and made the colors pop. What kind of features does it focus on to tell haze apart from the scene?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The task is **contrast-aware image dehazing**, aiming to separate the haze layer from true scene content to recover lost detail and color vibrance.

---

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A foggy or misty image from low-visibility outdoor conditions.  
- **Model**:  
  - **CLAIO-DeHaze** applies learned representations to detect **airlight distortions** and **contrast suppression**, distinguishing haze from object-level textures.  
  - Models like DRACO-DehazeNet refine this by learning **dense feature differences** between clear and hazy regions using a quadruplet contrastive approach.  
- **Output**: A restored image with vivid color, sharper edge structure, and haze-free visibility.

### âœ… Summary:

AI dehazing models detect **statistical haze artifacts** (e.g. luminance flattening, gray veil) and reconstruct natural color and edges by learning contrast relationships between clean and degraded samples.
