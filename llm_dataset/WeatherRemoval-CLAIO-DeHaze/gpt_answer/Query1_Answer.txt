ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I used AI to clean up a hazy mountain photo, and suddenly the distant peaks looked sharp and clear. How does it know which parts were obscured by haze and restore them so naturally?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is performing **image dehazing**, a task that aims to restore visibility in outdoor photos degraded by atmospheric haze. The challenge lies in estimating both the scene depth and airlight effects to recover the clean image.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A hazy image with low contrast and depth-dependent light scattering.  
- **Model**:  
  - **CLAIO-DeHaze** leverages contrast enhancement, luminance equalization, and guided learning to remove haze across regions with different intensities.  
  - It combines learned priors with color/texture recovery routines tuned for natural scenes like landscapes.  
- **Output**: A high-contrast, visually clearer image where haze-affected regions (e.g. distant mountains) are sharp and realistic.

### âœ… Summary:

CLAIO-DeHaze and DRACO-DehazeNet estimate light scattering patterns in hazy photos and apply detail-aware enhancement, restoring sharpness in atmospheric scenes like mountain landscapes.
