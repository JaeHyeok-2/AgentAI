ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I tried dehazing a city skyline and even the faint outlines of buildings in the background came back. How do models like this preserve structural detail while removing atmospheric blur?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

This is **structure-preserving dehazing**, targeting both **fog removal** and the **retention of edge-level geometry** in complex cityscapes.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A hazy urban image with distant buildings and skyline details occluded by fog.  
- **Model**:  
  - **CLAIO-DeHaze** employs global contrast normalization with local enhancement modules to bring out weak visual signals from structural edges.  
  - DRACO refines this with dense feature disambiguation using residual attention modules and contrastive haze-quality loss.  
- **Output**: A deblurred, edge-sharpened image that recovers occluded structures like skyscraper silhouettes or skyline contours.

### âœ… Summary:

AI dehazing models like CLAIO and DRACO are optimized to **enhance structural fidelity** while cleaning foggy images. They leverage both **global haze estimation** and **local edge attention** to recover fine architectural geometry.
