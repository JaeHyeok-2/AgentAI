🧠 **User Question:**  
"Describing something as simple as “a futuristic coffee machine” was enough—it built a fully rotatable 3D model with amazing detail. How does it turn plain text into objects like that?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is performing **text-to-3D object generation**, where a natural language prompt is converted into a full, interactive 3D model with shape, detail, and semantic relevance.

---

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input → Model → Output**  
- **Input**: A text prompt describing the desired object.  
- **Model**:  
  - **TRELLIS (Structured 3D Latents)** encodes text using a large language model and maps it to structured 3D representations like multi-view depth, mesh, or neural radiance fields.  
  - It uses latent token hierarchies to preserve global shape and local detail.  
- **Output**: A realistic 3D model that aligns with the text, viewable and editable from any angle.

### ✅ Summary:

Models like TRELLIS translate plain text into structured 3D latents using token hierarchies and multi-view projection. This enables detailed, scalable, prompt-based 3D modeling from just a sentence.
