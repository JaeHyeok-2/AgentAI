ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"Without needing sketches or blueprints, it generated 3D shapes for all my product ideasâ€”ready for use in mockups. What kind of model makes that level of creation so accessible?"

---

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

This is **sketch-free text-to-3D modeling**, where users generate printable, editable 3D assets from pure textâ€”no CAD or manual modeling required.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A product idea written in natural language.  
- **Model**:  
  - **TRELLIS** encodes the prompt into structured 3D latents using transformer-based text and geometry backbones.  
  - It generates a mesh or neural representation in multiple stagesâ€”starting from coarse shape and progressively refining detail.  
- **Output**: A realistic and rotatable 3D asset directly usable in design mockups or downstream rendering pipelines.

### âœ… Summary:

By combining latent-space transformers with progressive 3D refinement, models like TRELLIS make **3D creation accessible via text** aloneâ€”no sketches, scans, or CAD knowledge needed.
