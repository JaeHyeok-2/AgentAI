You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"Even vague ideas like “an elegant chair made of wood and metal” were interpreted perfectly, down to the curve of the legs. How can it understand design features that well from just words?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: Transformer neural networks show promising capabilities, in particular for uses in materials analysis, design and manufacturing, including their capacity to work effectively with both human language, symbols, code, and numerical data. Here we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as a tool that can support engineering analysis of materials, applied to retrieving key information about subject areas, developing research hypotheses, discovery of mechanistic relationships across disparate areas of knowledge, and writing and executing simulation codes for active knowledge generation based on physical ground truths. When used as sets of AI agents with specific features, capabilities, and instructions, LLMs can provide powerful problem solution strategies for applications in analysis and design problems. Our experiments focus on using a fine-tuned model, MechGPT, developed based on training data in the mechanics of materials domain. We first affirm how finetuning endows LLMs with reasonable understanding of domain knowledge. However, when queried outside the context of learned matter, LLMs can have difficulty to recall correct information. We show how this can be addressed using retrieval-augmented Ontological Knowledge Graph strategies that discern how the model understands what concepts are important and how they are related. Illustrated for a use case of relating distinct areas of knowledge - here, music and proteins - such strategies can also provide an interpretable graph structure with rich information at the node, edge and subgraph level. We discuss nonlinear sampling strategies and agent-based modeling applied to complex question answering, code generation and execution in the context of automated force field development from actively learned Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling, and data analysis.

Model: 1.5 million materials narratives generated by chatbots
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13687v1.pdf
Summary: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled a comprehensive exploration of materials for various applications. However, AI models often prioritize frequently encountered materials in the scientific literature, limiting the selection of suitable candidates based on inherent physical and chemical properties. To address this imbalance, we have generated a dataset of 1,494,017 natural language-material paragraphs based on combined OQMD, Materials Project, JARVIS, COD and AFLOW2 databases, which are dominated by ab initio calculations and tend to be much more evenly distributed on the periodic table. The generated text narratives were then polled and scored by both human experts and ChatGPT-4, based on three rubrics: technical accuracy, language and structure, and relevance and depth of content, showing similar scores but with human-scored depth of content being the most lagging. The merger of multi-modality data sources and large language model (LLM) holds immense potential for AI frameworks to help the exploration and discovery of solid-state materials for specific applications.

Model: What's in a Name? Evaluating Assembly-Part Semantic Knowledge in Language Models through User-Provided Names in CAD Files
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14275v1.pdf

Summary: Semantic knowledge of part-part and part-whole relationships in assemblies is useful for a variety of tasks from searching design repositories to the construction of engineering knowledge bases. In this work we propose that the natural language names designers use in Computer Aided Design (CAD) software are a valuable source of such knowledge, and that Large Language Models (LLMs) contain useful domain-specific information for working with this data as well as other CAD and engineering-related tasks.   In particular we extract and clean a large corpus of natural language part, feature and document names and use this to quantitatively demonstrate that a pre-trained language model can outperform numerous benchmarks on three self-supervised tasks, without ever having seen this data before. Moreover, we show that fine-tuning on the text data corpus further boosts the performance on all tasks, thus demonstrating the value of the text data which until now has been largely ignored. We also identify key limitations to using LLMs with text data alone, and our findings provide a strong motivation for further work into multi-modal text-geometry models.   To aid and encourage further work in this area we make all our data and code publicly available.
