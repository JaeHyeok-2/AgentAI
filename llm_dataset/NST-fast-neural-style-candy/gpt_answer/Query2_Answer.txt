🧠 **User Question:**  
"My plain photo instantly turned into a burst of pop-art colors. How does the AI keep the edges crisp while applying such vibrant styles so fast?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

This is **real-time neural style transfer**, aiming to re-color and re-texture a photo using a specific aesthetic style without losing key object boundaries or geometry.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input → Model → Output**  
- **Input**: A regular image and a pre-defined “mosaic” artistic style.  
- **Model**:  
  - **NST-fast-neural-style-mosaic** is a feed-forward network trained with perceptual losses derived from VGG feature layers to match style and preserve structure.  
  - The model learns where to inject texture or color variation (e.g., brush strokes, gradients) based on the original photo’s spatial hierarchy.  
- **Output**: A stylized image with consistent structure, sharp edges, and colorful aesthetic patterns applied layer-wise.

### ✅ Summary:

Real-time style transfer models like **mosaic NST** preserve structural edges using **perceptual feature alignment** and inject stylistic textures using learned visual hierarchies—all in milliseconds due to pre-trained feed-forward pipelines.
