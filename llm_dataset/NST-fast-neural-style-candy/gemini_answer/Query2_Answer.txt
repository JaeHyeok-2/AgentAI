1. What task is the user trying to perform?

[cite_start]The user is trying to perform **image stylization or neural style transfer** [cite: 26][cite_start], specifically applying "pop-art colors" to a plain photo while "keeping the edges crisp"[cite: 26]. The user also notes the speed of this process.

2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

A CNAPS AI-like workflow for fast and crisp image stylization would leverage models optimized for speed and precise content preservation, possibly through methods that aggregate appearance efficiently or align with human perception for quality.

* [cite_start]Input: A plain photo[cite: 26].

* Model (Core Style Transfer Model):
    * [cite_start]**NST-fast-neural-style-mosaic:** This model is a "fast neural style" model[cite: 31]. Such models are designed for rapid style transfer, allowing for fast application of vibrant styles. The "fast" nature implies an architecture that prioritizes efficiency while performing the transformation.

* Model (Related Concepts for Crisp Edges/Efficiency/Aesthetics):
    * [cite_start]**Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing (AGAP):** This work focuses on efficient 3D editing by learning the color field as an "explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image"[cite: 47]. [cite_start]Users can customize 3D editing via 2D image processing[cite: 47]. [cite_start]It complements the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query[cite: 48]. [cite_start]This approach supports various ways of 3D editing, including "stylization" [cite: 50][cite_start], and demonstrates "remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods"[cite: 51]. This capability to efficiently aggregate and manage appearance data in a 2D canonical image (which is then projected to 3D) is key to keeping edges crisp and processing styles fast, as it provides a structured way to handle textures and forms.
    * [cite_start]**A Large-scale AI-generated Image Inpainting Benchmark (SAGI):** While focused on inpainting, the SAGI pipeline aims to "automate the generative process" by "sampl[ing] prompts from a distribution that closely aligns with human perception" and evaluating content[cite: 41]. [cite_start]Experiments show that "semantic alignment significantly improves image quality and aesthetics" [cite: 43][cite_start], and "uncertainty guidance effectively identifies realistic manipulations"[cite: 43]. This focus on semantic alignment and aesthetic quality helps ensure that when applying vibrant styles, the AI maintains image quality and does not distort edges.
    * [cite_start]**Artificial Intelligence and Aesthetic Judgment:** This paper argues that encounters with outputs of modern generative AI models are "mediated by the same kinds of aesthetic judgments that organize our interactions with artwork"[cite: 32]. [cite_start]It posits that "generative AIs produce creative outputs in the style of human expression"[cite: 31]. This implies that the AI's method for applying vibrant styles while keeping edges crisp is influenced by learned aesthetic principles that guide it towards visually coherent and high-quality results.

* [cite_start]Output: A plain photo turns into a burst of pop-art colors [cite: 26] [cite_start]with crisp edges [cite: 26][cite_start], applied quickly[cite: 26]. This is achieved by fast neural style transfer models that efficiently aggregate and process appearance (like AGAP), and potentially leverage semantic alignment and aesthetic judgments to preserve structural integrity.
