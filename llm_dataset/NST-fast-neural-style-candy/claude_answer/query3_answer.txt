  - Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model integration understanding which areas benefit from intense coloring
  - Human perception alignment ensuring color application follows natural visual hierarchies
  - Quality assessment determining appropriate intensity levels for different photo regions
- **CHM-Corr Interactive Guidance** supports selective processing through:
  - Patch-wise correspondence prediction between input and training images for targeted color application
  - Feature importance mapping identifying key areas for color transformation
  - Interactive interface enabling precise control over which regions receive intense coloring
  - Attention map utilization determining optimal areas for vivid color application
- **AIGI-VC Quality Assessment** ensures natural appearance via:
  - AI-generated image quality assessment focusing on visual communication effectiveness
  - Information clarity and emotional interaction assessment ensuring appropriate color placement
  - Human preference alignment guaranteeing candy colorization maintains visual appeal
  - Fine-grained preference descriptions guiding optimal color intensity and placement decisions

**Output:** Artistically transformed photo with vivid candy-like colors applied intelligently to enhance visual impact while perfectly preserving original shapes and structural elements

## 3. Technical Implementation for Intelligent Color Area Selection
The intelligent area selection capability stems from:
- **Content-aware style transfer:** Fast Neural Style uses content understanding to preserve shapes while applying colors
- **Semantic region identification:** SAGI principles identify semantically important areas for color application
- **Attention-based selection:** CHM-Corr uses attention mechanisms to determine optimal coloring regions
- **Quality-guided placement:** AIGI-VC assessment ensures color application enhances rather than detracts from visual appeal
- **Correspondence mapping:** Patch-wise analysis enables precise regional color application based on learned patterns
