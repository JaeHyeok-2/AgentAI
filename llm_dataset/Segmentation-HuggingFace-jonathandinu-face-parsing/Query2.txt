Model: HeadRecon: High-Fidelity 3D Head Reconstruction from Monocular Video
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08863v1.pdf
Summary: Recently, the reconstruction of high-fidelity 3D head models from static portrait image has made great progress. However, most methods require multi-view or multi-illumination information, which therefore put forward high requirements for data acquisition. In this paper, we study the reconstruction of high-fidelity 3D head models from arbitrary monocular videos. Non-rigid structure from motion (NRSFM) methods have been widely used to solve such problems according to the two-dimensional correspondence between different frames. However, the inaccurate correspondence caused by high-complex hair structures and various facial expression changes would heavily influence the reconstruction accuracy. To tackle these problems, we propose a prior-guided dynamic implicit neural network. Specifically, we design a two-part dynamic deformation field to transform the current frame space to the canonical one. We further model the head geometry in the canonical space with a learnable signed distance field (SDF) and optimize it using the volumetric rendering with the guidance of two-main head priors to improve the reconstruction accuracy and robustness. Extensive ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Model: FaceCom: Towards High-fidelity 3D Facial Shape Completion via Optimization and Inpainting Guidance
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02074v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/dragonylee/facecom
Summary: We propose FaceCom, a method for 3D facial shape completion, which delivers high-fidelity results for incomplete facial inputs of arbitrary forms. Unlike end-to-end shape completion methods based on point clouds or voxels, our approach relies on a mesh-based generative network that is easy to optimize, enabling it to handle shape completion for irregular facial scans. We first train a shape generator on a mixed 3D facial dataset containing 2405 identities. Based on the incomplete facial input, we fit complete faces using an optimization approach under image inpainting guidance. The completion results are refined through a post-processing step. FaceCom demonstrates the ability to effectively and naturally complete facial scan data with varying missing regions and degrees of missing areas. Our method can be used in medical prosthetic fabrication and the registration of deficient scanning data. Our experimental results demonstrate that FaceCom achieves exceptional performance in fitting and shape completion tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/dragonylee/FaceCom.git.

Model: Pose Modulated Avatars from Video
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11951v3.pdf
Summary: It is now possible to reconstruct dynamic human motion and shape from a sparse set of cameras using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) driven by an underlying skeleton. However, a challenge remains to model the deformation of cloth and skin in relation to skeleton pose. Unlike existing avatar models that are learned implicitly or rely on a proxy surface, our approach is motivated by the observation that different poses necessitate unique frequency assignments. Neglecting this distinction yields noisy artifacts in smooth areas or blurs fine-grained texture and shape details in sharp regions. We develop a two-branch neural network that is adaptive and explicit in the frequency domain. The first branch is a graph neural network that models correlations among body parts locally, taking skeleton pose as input. The second branch combines these correlation features to a set of global frequencies and then modulates the feature encoding. Our experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of preserving details and generalization capabilities.
