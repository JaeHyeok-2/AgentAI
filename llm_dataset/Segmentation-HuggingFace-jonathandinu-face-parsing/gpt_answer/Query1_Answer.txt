ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I tried an app that highlights different parts of the faceâ€”like lips, eyebrows, and eyesâ€”and it worked even in dim lighting. How can AI recognize such tiny face features?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is performing **fine-grained facial feature segmentation**, aiming to detect small, specific regions like lips, eyebrows, eyes, etc., across varying lighting conditions.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: A facial image under potentially poor lighting.  
- **Model**:  
  - **MaskFormer-Swin** uses hierarchical Swin Transformers and pixel-level attention via the mask classification paradigm.  
  - It segments each semantic region (eye, brow, skin) by integrating multiscale context and attention-refined features, maintaining precision in shadows or occlusion.  
- **Output**: A dense segmentation mask that highlights precise facial features, even under illumination variation.
