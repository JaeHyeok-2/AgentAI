Based on the provided models and papers, here is the analysis of the user's question about tracking small facial changes with makeup or shadows:

## 1. Task Analysis
The user is performing **robust facial parsing and tracking** under challenging conditions including makeup application and shadow variations. This involves maintaining accurate facial part separation and detection despite surface appearance changes that can obscure natural facial boundaries.

## 2. CNAPS AI-like Workflow (Input → Model → Output)

**Input:** Face images or video with makeup, shadows, or other appearance modifications that change natural facial appearance

**Model Processing:**
- **Face Parsing (Segmentation-HuggingFace-jonathandinu-face-parsing)** provides the core facial segmentation capability through:
  - Pixel-level classification of different facial regions despite appearance modifications
  - Semantic understanding of facial structure independent of surface appearance changes
  - Real-time parsing capabilities for continuous tracking applications
- **HeadRecon (High-Fidelity 3D Head Reconstruction)** enhances robustness through:
  - Prior-guided dynamic implicit neural network handling complex facial variations
  - Two-part dynamic deformation field transforming current frame space to canonical representation
  - Learnable signed distance field (SDF) modeling head geometry in canonical space
  - Volumetric rendering with head priors improving reconstruction accuracy despite appearance changes
- **FaceCom (3D Facial Shape Completion)** provides structural understanding via:
  - Mesh-based generative network trained on 2405 facial identities for robust completion
  - Optimization approach under image inpainting guidance maintaining facial structure consistency
  - Handling varying degrees of missing or obscured facial areas effectively
  - Post-processing refinement ensuring high-fidelity facial geometry preservation
- **Pose Modulated Avatars** enables adaptive frequency handling through:
  - Two-branch neural network adaptive and explicit in frequency domain
  - Graph neural network modeling correlations among body parts locally
  - Feature encoding modulation adapting to different poses and expressions
  - Superior detail preservation and generalization capabilities across variations

**Output:** Consistent facial part segmentation maintaining accurate boundaries and classifications despite makeup, shadows, or other appearance modifications

## 3. Technical Implementation for Tracking Small Changes
The robust tracking capability results from:
- **Canonical space representation:** HeadRecon's transformation to canonical space enables consistent tracking despite appearance variations
- **3D structural understanding:** FaceCom's mesh-based approach maintains geometric consistency across different appearances
- **Adaptive frequency processing:** Pose Modulated Avatars adjust frequency assignments based on specific facial configurations
- **Prior-guided optimization:** Integration of facial priors ensures structural consistency during challenging conditions
- **Dynamic deformation modeling:** Two-part deformation fields handle complex facial variations while preserving feature relationships
