    "Query1": "Some of my photos were flagged as inappropriate even without tags. How does AI know what’s NSFW just from the image alone?\n",
    "Query2": "I uploaded a photo with no obvious nudity, but it still got blurred. Can AI really judge the context of an image, not just what’s visible?\n",
    "Query3": "Some of my medical or artistic photos get flagged too. How well can AI tell the difference between explicit and non-explicit content?\n",
    "Summary": "This paper proposes Vision Transformer (ViT), which applies a pure Transformer architecture directly to image classification by treating image patches as tokens. The model is pre-trained on large-scale image datasets and then fine-tuned on smaller benchmarks. The ViT model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional CNN-based architectures when trained on sufficiently large datasets, outperforming them with substantially lower computational resources. Key experiments show that ViT achieves state-of-the-art results on several standard image classification benchmarks."

How does AI manage to generate these realistic background details without having direct visual references? What kind of approaches and data are commonly used for this task today?",
    "Summary": "The authors introduce Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), a two-stage framework that first learns a perceptual autoencoder to compress images into a lower-dimensional latent space and then trains a diffusion model in that space. Operating on latents cuts both training and inference cost while preserving detail, enabling megapixel synthesis. Cross-attention layers connect arbitrary conditioning inputs—such as text, semantic maps or bounding boxes—to the UNet backbone, making the generator highly flexible. LDMs set new state-of-the-art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional synthesis, and achieve competitive results on text-to-image, unconditional generation and super-resolution, all with markedly fewer GPU resources than pixel-based diffusion models"

    "Summary": "The authors propose MIMO-UNet, a single U-shaped network that accepts the blurry image at multiple down-scaled resolutions and outputs deblurred results for those scales in one pass. A multi-input single encoder (MISE) ingests each resolution, while a multi-output single decoder (MOSD) produces matching deblurred images. Cross-scale information is exchanged by an asymmetric feature-fusion module, and training employs a multi-scale content loss combined with a frequency-domain reconstruction loss.

    "Summary": "The paper introduces SwinIR, an image-restoration network built on the hierarchical Swin Transformer. It consists of a shallow convolutional feature extractor, a deep stack of Residual Swin Transformer Blocks (RSTBs), and a reconstruction head that merges shallow and deep features. Trained with task-specific losses, SwinIR attains superior PSNR and SSIM across six restoration benchmarks—including classical, lightweight, and real-world super-resolution, grayscale and color denoising, and compression-artifact reduction—while using up to 67 % fewer parameters than previous methods reported in the paper."

    "Summary": "The paper introduces BLIP, a two-part framework comprising a Multimodal Mixture of Encoder-Decoder (MED) architecture and a Captioning-and-Filtering (CapFilt) data bootstrapping strategy. MED can operate as an image encoder, an image-grounded text encoder, or an image-grounded text decoder, and is jointly pre-trained with image–text contrastive, image–text matching, and image-conditioned language-modeling losses. CapFilt first uses a fine-tuned captioner to generate synthetic captions for web images, then applies a fine-tuned filter to discard noisy original and synthetic captions, producing a cleaner training set. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on image–text retrieval, captioning, VQA, NLVR2, visual dialog, and zero-shot transfers to video-language tasks."

    "Summary": "The paper proposes ViLT, a single-stream Transformer that handles images and text with the same lightweight patch projection used for textual tokens, completely removing CNNs and object detectors. Visual inputs are split into 32 × 32 patches, linearly embedded, concatenated with word embeddings, and processed by a 12-layer ViT-based Transformer initialized from ViT-B/32 weights. Pre-training combines image–text contrastive alignment, image–text matching with word-patch alignment, and masked language modeling (with whole-word masking). ViLT attains competitive or superior results on VQAv2, NLVR2, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K while running tens of times faster and using fewer parameters than previous VLP models."

    "Summary": "The authors revisit RCAN and create RCAN-it, a minimally modified version that replaces ReLU with SiLU and is trained with modern large-batch, large-patch, cosine-annealed schedules. Extensive ablations reveal that RCAN’s main limitation is underfitting: simply extending training iterations, increasing batch size, and using a stronger optimizer improve performance, while typical regularizers hurt. With these updates, RCAN-it matches or exceeds nearly all CNN-based SR models published after RCAN on standard benchmarks and narrows the gap to recent Transformer approaches. Training efficiency is also improved—comparable accuracy is reached in one quarter of the original training time."

A convolutional backbone first extracts a compact feature map; a Transformer encoder–decoder then reasons globally over the image and a fixed number of learned object queries; finally, a shared feed-forward head emits class probabilities (including a “no-object” class) and normalized box coordinates for every query. Training uses a bipartite-matching loss that pairs each ground-truth object with one unique prediction and penalizes classification and box regression errors. DETR matches or surpasses a strong Faster R-CNN baseline on the COCO benchmark, excels on large objects, and extends cleanly to panoptic segmentation by adding a lightweight mask head."

The network treats an image as a sequence of patches plus a small set of learnable detection tokens; through global self-attention it reasons about apparel context and outputs fixed-length sets of class logits and bounding-box coordinates. Training uses the Hungarian matching loss to align each ground-truth garment with exactly one prediction, encouraging direct set output.

The shifted-window self-attention inside each RSTB yields both local detail handling and cross-window interaction, while a long skip connection feeds low-frequency features directly to the reconstructor. Trained on DIV2K (and optionally Flickr2K) with standard pixel or Charbonnier losses, SwinIR sets new benchmarks on classical, lightweight, and real-world super-resolution, grayscale and color denoising, and JPEG artifact removal—gaining up to 0.45 dB PSNR over previous best CNNs with up to 67 % fewer parameters."

    "Query3": "I used AI to edit out backgrounds, and it kept only the people—no matter how complex the scene was. How can it focus so well just on what I want?\n",
    "Summary": "MaskFormer converts any fully convolutional network into a mask-classification system. A pixel decoder produces per-pixel embeddings; a Transformer decoder generates a fixed set of query embeddings, each yielding one class prediction and one mask embedding. The binary masks are recovered by a dot product between per-pixel and mask embeddings, supervised with a classification loss and a focal-plus-dice mask loss under Hungarian matching. Without altering architecture or losses, the same model attains state-of-the-art scores on semantic (e.g., 55.6 mIoU on ADE20K) and panoptic segmentation (52.7 PQ on COCO), particularly excelling when class vocabularies are large."

    "Summary": "SegFormer-FaceParsing fine-tunes the SegFormer MiT-B0 backbone on the CelebAMask-HQ dataset, predicting 19 facial classes plus background. The hierarchical Transformer encoder captures global context, and the all-MLP decoder fuses multi-scale features without convolutions. With roughly 3.7 M parameters, the model runs in real time on standard GPUs and achieves high mean IoU across facial regions, accurately separating subtle boundaries such as eye shadow and inner-lip areas."

Fine-tuned on the ADE20K dataset at 512 × 512 resolution, the model segments 150 classes in a single forward pass, achieving strong mean IoU while maintaining moderate parameter count and fast inference. Thanks to overlapping patch embeddings and efficient local–global self-attention, it captures both fine details and global context without needing feature pyramids or dilated convolutions."

Fine-tuned from FLAN-T5-XL on approximately 300 K curated prompt pairs, the model learns to inject artist references, camera settings, lighting cues, aspect ratios, and negative keywords while preserving the user’s core intent. Offline evaluations and user studies show that images produced with Promptist-enhanced prompts score markedly higher in realism, relevance, and aesthetic appeal than those from raw inputs. The model is released under the MIT license and runs in under 2 GB of VRAM, making it easy to embed in existing creative pipelines."

To overcome limited HDR training data, the network is first pretrained on large-scale inpainting, then fine-tuned for HDR using simulated LDR–HDR pairs; a patch-sampling strategy focuses this second stage on challenging textured regions. Quantitative tests on synthetic images and qualitative comparisons on real photographs show lower MSE, higher HDR-VDP-2 scores, and fewer artefacts than previous state-of-the-art approaches."

    "Summary": "ResShift links the low- and high-resolution images through a short Markov chain that gradually shifts their residual instead of diffusing from Gaussian noise. Starting near the LR image, only 15 sampling steps suffice to reach the HR target. A learnable UNet operating in latent space predicts the clean HR image at each step. A flexible noise schedule, parameterised by a residual-shift rate and a noise-strength factor, lets users trade fidelity for realism. On synthetic ImageNet and multiple real-world datasets, ResShift matches or surpasses state-of-the-art GAN and diffusion baselines while cutting inference time by roughly 4× relative to latent diffusion accelerated by DDIM."

    "Summary": "This model adapts the original MIRNet architecture—designed for general image restoration—to the specific task of low-light enhancement. The network contains a multi-scale residual encoder–decoder in which information is exchanged across three spatial resolutions via attention-guided feature fusion. Trained on paired low/normal-exposure images, the model learns to suppress noise, boost luminance, and correct color casts simultaneously. A publicly released checkpoint (≈38 M parameters) runs at full resolution on commodity GPUs and substantially improves PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE scores over classic histogram equalization or Retinex-based methods."
