Model: Human and AI Perceptual Differences in Image Classification Errors
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08733v2.pdf
Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) models for computer vision trained with supervised machine learning are assumed to solve classification tasks by imitating human behavior learned from training labels. Most efforts in recent vision research focus on measuring the model task performance using standardized benchmarks such as accuracy. However, limited work has sought to understand the perceptual difference between humans and machines. To fill this gap, this study first analyzes the statistical distributions of mistakes from the two sources and then explores how task difficulty level affects these distributions. We find that even when AI learns an excellent model from the training data, one that outperforms humans in overall accuracy, these AI models have significant and consistent differences from human perception. We demonstrate the importance of studying these differences with a simple human-AI teaming algorithm that outperforms humans alone, AI alone, or AI-AI teaming.

Model: Human-Centered Evaluation of XAI Methods
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07534v2.pdf
Summary: In the ever-evolving field of Artificial Intelligence, a critical challenge has been to decipher the decision-making processes within the so-called "black boxes" in deep learning. Over recent years, a plethora of methods have emerged, dedicated to explaining decisions across diverse tasks. Particularly in tasks like image classification, these methods typically identify and emphasize the pivotal pixels that most influence a classifier's prediction. Interestingly, this approach mirrors human behavior: when asked to explain our rationale for classifying an image, we often point to the most salient features or aspects. Capitalizing on this parallel, our research embarked on a user-centric study. We sought to objectively measure the interpretability of three leading explanation methods: (1) Prototypical Part Network, (2) Occlusion, and (3) Layer-wise Relevance Propagation. Intriguingly, our results highlight that while the regions spotlighted by these methods can vary widely, they all offer humans a nearly equivalent depth of understanding. This enables users to discern and categorize images efficiently, reinforcing the value of these methods in enhancing AI transparency.

Model: ARTxAI: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Curates Deep Representation Learning for Artistic Images using Fuzzy Techniques
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15284v1.pdf
Summary: Automatic art analysis employs different image processing techniques to classify and categorize works of art. When working with artistic images, we need to take into account further considerations compared to classical image processing. This is because such artistic paintings change drastically depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style. This can result in features that perform very well in a given task but do not grasp the whole of the visual and symbolic information contained in a painting. In this paper, we show how the features obtained from different tasks in artistic image classification are suitable to solve other ones of similar nature. We present different methods to improve the generalization capabilities and performance of artistic classification systems. Furthermore, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence method to map known visual traits of an image with the features used by the deep learning model considering fuzzy rules. These rules show the patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task and how effective is each of the patterns found. Our results show that our proposed context-aware features can achieve up to $6\%$ and $26\%$ more accurate results than other context- and non-context-aware solutions, respectively, depending on the specific task. We also show that some of the features used by these models can be more clearly correlated to visual traits in the original image than others.
