Model: UrbanBIS: a Large-scale Benchmark for Fine-grained Urban Building Instance Segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02627v1.pdf
Summary: We present the UrbanBIS benchmark for large-scale 3D urban understanding, supporting practical urban-level semantic and building-level instance segmentation. UrbanBIS comprises six real urban scenes, with 2.5 billion points, covering a vast area of 10.78 square kilometers and 3,370 buildings, captured by 113,346 views of aerial photogrammetry. Particularly, UrbanBIS provides not only semantic-level annotations on a rich set of urban objects, including buildings, vehicles, vegetation, roads, and bridges, but also instance-level annotations on the buildings. Further, UrbanBIS is the first 3D dataset that introduces fine-grained building sub-categories, considering a wide variety of shapes for different building types. Besides, we propose B-Seg, a building instance segmentation method to establish UrbanBIS. B-Seg adopts an end-to-end framework with a simple yet effective strategy for handling large-scale point clouds. Compared with mainstream methods, B-Seg achieves better accuracy with faster inference speed on UrbanBIS. In addition to the carefully-annotated point clouds, UrbanBIS provides high-resolution aerial-acquisition photos and high-quality large-scale 3D reconstruction models, which shall facilitate a wide range of studies such as multi-view stereo, urban LOD generation, aerial path planning, autonomous navigation, road network extraction, and so on, thus serving as an important platform for many intelligent city applications.

Model: On the Effect of Image Resolution on Semantic Segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05398v1.pdf
Summary: High-resolution semantic segmentation requires substantial computational resources. Traditional approaches in the field typically downscale the input images before processing and then upscale the low-resolution outputs back to their original dimensions. While this strategy effectively identifies broad regions, it often misses finer details. In this study, we demonstrate that a streamlined model capable of directly producing high-resolution segmentations can match the performance of more complex systems that generate lower-resolution results. By simplifying the network architecture, we enable the processing of images at their native resolution. Our approach leverages a bottom-up information propagation technique across various scales, which we have empirically shown to enhance segmentation accuracy. We have rigorously tested our method using leading-edge semantic segmentation datasets. Specifically, for the Cityscapes dataset, we further boost accuracy by applying the Noisy Student Training technique.

Model: Non-Hierarchical Transformers for Pedestrian Segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02506v1.pdf
Summary: We propose a methodology to address the challenge of instance segmentation in autonomous systems, specifically targeting accessibility and inclusivity. Our approach utilizes a non-hierarchical Vision Transformer variant, EVA-02, combined with a Cascade Mask R-CNN mask head. Through fine-tuning on the AVA instance segmentation challenge dataset, we achieved a promising mean Average Precision (mAP) of 52.68\% on the test set. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of ViT-based architectures in enhancing vision capabilities and accommodating the unique needs of individuals with disabilities.
