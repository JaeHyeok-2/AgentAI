You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I enlarged a tiny character illustration 12× and the brush strokes stayed intact—perfect for print. What extra signals does AI predict inside to keep texture from falling apart at such huge magnifications?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: Bias significantly undermines both the accuracy and trustworthiness of machine learning models. To date, one of the strongest biases observed in image classification models is texture bias-where models overly rely on texture information rather than shape information. Yet, existing approaches for measuring and mitigating texture bias have not been able to capture how textures impact model robustness in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce the Texture Association Value (TAV), a novel metric that quantifies how strongly models rely on the presence of specific textures when classifying objects. Leveraging TAV, we demonstrate that model accuracy and robustness are heavily influenced by texture. Our results show that texture bias explains the existence of natural adversarial examples, where over 90% of these samples contain textures that are misaligned with the learned texture of their true label, resulting in confident mispredictions.

Model: DeepArt: A Benchmark to Advance Fidelity Research in AI-Generated Content
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10407v2.pdf
Summary: This paper explores the image synthesis capabilities of GPT-4, a leading multi-modal large language model. We establish a benchmark for evaluating the fidelity of texture features in images generated by GPT-4, comprising manually painted pictures and their AI-generated counterparts. The contributions of this study are threefold: First, we provide an in-depth analysis of the fidelity of image synthesis features based on GPT-4, marking the first such study on this state-of-the-art model. Second, the quantitative and qualitative experiments fully reveals the limitations of the GPT-4 model in image synthesis. Third, we have compiled a unique benchmark of manual drawings and corresponding GPT-4-generated images, introducing a new task to advance fidelity research in AI-generated content (AIGC). The dataset is available at: \url{https://github.com/rickwang28574/DeepArt}.

Model: Elastic-DETR: Making Image Resolution Learnable with Content-Specific Network Prediction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06341v1.pdf
Summary: Multi-scale image resolution is a de facto standard approach in modern object detectors, such as DETR. This technique allows for the acquisition of various scale information from multiple image resolutions. However, manual hyperparameter selection of the resolution can restrict its flexibility, which is informed by prior knowledge, necessitating human intervention. This work introduces a novel strategy for learnable resolution, called Elastic-DETR, enabling elastic utilization of multiple image resolutions. Our network provides an adaptive scale factor based on the content of the image with a compact scale prediction module (< 2 GFLOPs). The key aspect of our method lies in how to determine the resolution without prior knowledge. We present two loss functions derived from identified key components for resolution optimization: scale loss, which increases adaptiveness according to the image, and distribution loss, which determines the overall degree of scaling based on network performance. By leveraging the resolution's flexibility, we can demonstrate various models that exhibit varying trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity. We empirically show that our scheme can unleash the potential of a wide spectrum of image resolutions without constraining flexibility. Our models on MS COCO establish a maximum accuracy gain of 3.5%p or 26% decrease in computation than MS-trained DN-DETR.
