You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I upscaled a tiny character drawing by 12× and it still had visible brushstrokes—great for print. What does AI add internally to keep that texture so clean even at such large sizes?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: DeepArt: A Benchmark to Advance Fidelity Research in AI-Generated Content
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10407v2.pdf
Summary: This paper explores the image synthesis capabilities of GPT-4, a leading multi-modal large language model. We establish a benchmark for evaluating the fidelity of texture features in images generated by GPT-4, comprising manually painted pictures and their AI-generated counterparts. The contributions of this study are threefold: First, we provide an in-depth analysis of the fidelity of image synthesis features based on GPT-4, marking the first such study on this state-of-the-art model. Second, the quantitative and qualitative experiments fully reveals the limitations of the GPT-4 model in image synthesis. Third, we have compiled a unique benchmark of manual drawings and corresponding GPT-4-generated images, introducing a new task to advance fidelity research in AI-generated content (AIGC).

Model: LinFusion: 1 GPU, 1 Minute, 16K Image
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02097v3.pdf

Summary: Modern diffusion models, particularly those utilizing a Transformer-based UNet for denoising, rely heavily on self-attention operations to manage complex spatial relationships, thus achieving impressive generation performance. However, this existing paradigm faces significant challenges in generating high-resolution visual content due to its quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to the number of spatial tokens. To address this limitation, we aim at a novel linear attention mechanism as an alternative in this paper. Specifically, we begin our exploration from recently introduced models with linear complexity, e.g., Mamba2, RWKV6, Gated Linear Attention, etc, and identify two key features--attention normalization and non-causal inference--that enhance high-resolution visual generation performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a generalized linear attention paradigm, which serves as a low-rank approximation of a wide spectrum of popular linear token mixers. To save the training cost and better leverage pre-trained models, we initialize our models and distill the knowledge from pre-trained StableDiffusion (SD). We find that the distilled model, termed LinFusion, achieves performance on par with or superior to the original SD after only modest training, while significantly reducing time and memory complexity. Extensive experiments on SD-v1.5, SD-v2.1, and SD-XL demonstrate that LinFusion enables satisfactory and efficient zero-shot cross-resolution generation, accommodating ultra-resolution images like 16K on a single GPU. Moreover, it is highly compatible with pre-trained SD components and pipelines, such as ControlNet, IP-Adapter, DemoFusion, DistriFusion, etc, requiring no adaptation efforts.
