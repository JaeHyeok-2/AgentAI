Model: CoF: Coarse to Fine-Grained Image Understanding for Multi-modal Large Language Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16869v1.pdf

Summary: The impressive performance of Large Language Model (LLM) has prompted researchers to develop Multi-modal LLM (MLLM), which has shown great potential for various multi-modal tasks. However, current MLLM often struggles to effectively address fine-grained multi-modal challenges. We argue that this limitation is closely linked to the models' visual grounding capabilities. The restricted spatial awareness and perceptual acuity of visual encoders frequently lead to interference from irrelevant background information in images, causing the models to overlook subtle but crucial details. As a result, achieving fine-grained regional visual comprehension becomes difficult. In this paper, we break down multi-modal understanding into two stages, from Coarse to Fine (CoF). In the first stage, we prompt the MLLM to locate the approximate area of the answer. In the second stage, we further enhance the model's focus on relevant areas within the image through visual prompt engineering, adjusting attention weights of pertinent regions. This, in turn, improves both visual grounding and overall performance in downstream tasks. Our experiments show that this approach significantly boosts the performance of baseline models, demonstrating notable generalization and effectiveness.

Model: FinchGPT: a Transformer based language model for birdsong analysis
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00344v1.pdf
Summary: The long-range dependencies among the tokens, which originate from hierarchical structures, are a defining hallmark of human language. However, whether similar dependencies exist within the sequential vocalization of non-human animals remains a topic of investigation. Transformer architectures, known for their ability to model long-range dependencies among tokens, provide a powerful tool for investigating this phenomenon. In this study, we employed the Transformer architecture to analyze the songs of Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata domestica), which are characterized by their highly variable and complex syllable sequences. To this end, we developed FinchGPT, a Transformer-based model trained on a textualized corpus of birdsongs, which outperformed other architecture models in this domain. Attention weight analysis revealed that FinchGPT effectively captures long-range dependencies within syllables sequences. Furthermore, reverse engineering approaches demonstrated the impact of computational and biological manipulations on its performance: restricting FinchGPT's attention span and disrupting birdsong syntax through the ablation of specific brain nuclei markedly influenced the model's outputs. Our study highlights the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) in deciphering the complexities of animal vocalizations, offering a novel framework for exploring the structural properties of non-human communication systems while shedding light on the computational distinctions between biological brains and artificial neural networks.

Model: Interpreting Pretrained Speech Models for Automatic Speech Assessment of Voice Disorders
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00531v1.pdf
Summary: Speech contains information that is clinically relevant to some diseases, which has the potential to be used for health assessment. Recent work shows an interest in applying deep learning algorithms, especially pretrained large speech models to the applications of Automatic Speech Assessment. One question that has not been explored is how these models output the results based on their inputs. In this work, we train and compare two configurations of Audio Spectrogram Transformer in the context of Voice Disorder Detection and apply the attention rollout method to produce model relevance maps, the computed relevance of the spectrogram regions when the model makes predictions. We use these maps to analyse how models make predictions in different conditions and to show that the spread of attention is reduced as a model is finetuned, and the model attention is concentrated on specific phoneme regions.
