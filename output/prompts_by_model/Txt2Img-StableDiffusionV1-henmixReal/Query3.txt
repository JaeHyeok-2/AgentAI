You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I changed the same prompt from “real face” to “sketched face” and everything morphed smoothly—eyes, lips, proportions intact. How does AI track visual consistency when swapping styles mid-prompt?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: In the evolving domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools in content creation. Despite their remarkable capability, existing models still face challenges in achieving controlled generation with a consistent style, requiring costly fine-tuning or often inadequately transferring the visual elements due to content leakage. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, \ours, to produce a diverse range of images while maintaining specific style elements and nuances. During the denoising process, we keep the query from original features while swapping the key and value with those from reference features in the late self-attention layers. This approach allows for the visual style prompting without any fine-tuning, ensuring that generated images maintain a faithful style. Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, best reflecting the style of the references and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts most accurately.

Model: SDFD: Building a Versatile Synthetic Face Image Dataset with Diverse Attributes
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17255v2.pdf
Summary: AI systems rely on extensive training on large datasets to address various tasks. However, image-based systems, particularly those used for demographic attribute prediction, face significant challenges. Many current face image datasets primarily focus on demographic factors such as age, gender, and skin tone, overlooking other crucial facial attributes like hairstyle and accessories. This narrow focus limits the diversity of the data and consequently the robustness of AI systems trained on them. This work aims to address this limitation by proposing a methodology for generating synthetic face image datasets that capture a broader spectrum of facial diversity. Specifically, our approach integrates a systematic prompt formulation strategy, encompassing not only demographics and biometrics but also non-permanent traits like make-up, hairstyle, and accessories. These prompts guide a state-of-the-art text-to-image model in generating a comprehensive dataset of high-quality realistic images and can be used as an evaluation set in face analysis systems. Compared to existing datasets, our proposed dataset proves equally or more challenging in image classification tasks while being much smaller in size.

Model: Diversify Question Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Style Transfer

Summary: Given a textual passage and an answer, humans are able to ask questions with various expressions, but this ability is still challenging for most question generation (QG) systems. Existing solutions mainly focus on the internal knowledge within the given passage or the semantic word space for diverse content planning. These methods, however, have not considered the potential of external knowledge for expression diversity. To bridge this gap, we propose RAST, a framework for Retrieval-Augmented Style Transfer, where the objective is to utilize the style of diverse templates for question generation. For training RAST, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach that maximizes a weighted combination of diversity reward and consistency reward. Here, the consistency reward is computed by a Question-Answering (QA) model, whereas the diversity reward measures how much the final output mimics the retrieved template. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous diversity-driven baselines on diversity while being comparable in terms of consistency scores.
