You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I nudged the style from realistic to slightly illustrated, and the lighting and contours stayed consistent. How does AI keep structural detail while shifting between realism and illustration?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Model: ARTxAI: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Curates Deep Representation Learning for Artistic Images using Fuzzy Techniques
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15284v1.pdf
Summary: Automatic art analysis employs different image processing techniques to classify and categorize works of art. When working with artistic images, we need to take into account further considerations compared to classical image processing. This is because such artistic paintings change drastically depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style. This can result in features that perform very well in a given task but do not grasp the whole of the visual and symbolic information contained in a painting. In this paper, we show how the features obtained from different tasks in artistic image classification are suitable to solve other ones of similar nature. We present different methods to improve the generalization capabilities and performance of artistic classification systems. Furthermore, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence method to map known visual traits of an image with the features used by the deep learning model considering fuzzy rules. These rules show the patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task and how effective is each of the patterns found. Our results show that our proposed context-aware features can achieve up to $6\%$ and $26\%$ more accurate results than other context- and non-context-aware solutions, respectively, depending on the specific task. We also show that some of the features used by these models can be more clearly correlated to visual traits in the original image than others.

Model: REAL: Realism Evaluation of Text-to-Image Generation Models for Effective Data Augmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10663v1.pdf
Summary: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation models have transformed the field. However, challenges persist in generating images that reflect demanding textual descriptions, especially for fine-grained details and unusual relationships. Existing evaluation metrics focus on text-image alignment but overlook the realism of the generated image, which can be crucial for downstream applications like data augmentation in machine learning. To address this gap, we propose REAL, an automatic evaluation framework that assesses realism of T2I outputs along three dimensions: fine-grained visual attributes, unusual visual relationships, and visual styles. REAL achieves a Spearman's rho score of up to 0.62 in alignment with human judgement and demonstrates utility in ranking and filtering augmented data for tasks like image captioning, classification, and visual relationship detection. Empirical results show that high-scoring images evaluated by our metrics improve F1 scores of image classification by up to 11.3%, while low-scoring ones degrade that by up to 4.95%. We benchmark four major T2I models across the realism dimensions, providing insights for future improvements in T2I output realism.

Model: Toon3D: Seeing Cartoons from New Perspectives
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10320v3.pdf
Summary: We recover the underlying 3D structure from images of cartoons and anime depicting the same scene. This is an interesting problem domain because images in creative media are often depicted without explicit geometric consistency for storytelling and creative expression-they are only 3D in a qualitative sense. While humans can easily perceive the underlying 3D scene from these images, existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods that assume 3D consistency fail catastrophically. We present Toon3D for reconstructing geometrically inconsistent images. Our key insight is to deform the input images while recovering camera poses and scene geometry, effectively explaining away geometrical inconsistencies to achieve consistency. This process is guided by the structure inferred from monocular depth predictions. We curate a dataset with multi-view imagery from cartoons and anime that we annotate with reliable sparse correspondences using our user-friendly annotation tool. Our recovered point clouds can be plugged into novel-view synthesis methods to experience cartoons from viewpoints never drawn before. We evaluate against classical and recent learning-based SfM methods, where Toon3D is able to obtain more reliable camera poses and scene geometry.
