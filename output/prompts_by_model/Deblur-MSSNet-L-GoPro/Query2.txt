Model: A-BDD: Leveraging Data Augmentations for Safe Autonomous Driving in Adverse Weather and Lighting
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06071v2.pdf
Summary: High-autonomy vehicle functions rely on machine learning (ML) algorithms to understand the environment. Despite displaying remarkable performance in fair weather scenarios, perception algorithms are heavily affected by adverse weather and lighting conditions. To overcome these difficulties, ML engineers mainly rely on comprehensive real-world datasets. However, the difficulties in real-world data collection for critical areas of the operational design domain (ODD) often means synthetic data is required for perception training and safety validation. Thus, we present A-BDD, a large set of over 60,000 synthetically augmented images based on BDD100K that are equipped with semantic segmentation and bounding box annotations (inherited from the BDD100K dataset). The dataset contains augmented data for rain, fog, overcast and sunglare/shadow with varying intensity levels. We further introduce novel strategies utilizing feature-based image quality metrics like FID and CMMD, which help identify useful augmented and real-world data for ML training and testing. By conducting experiments on A-BDD, we provide evidence that data augmentations can play a pivotal role in closing performance gaps in adverse weather and lighting conditions.

Model: An Ensemble Model for Distorted Images in Real Scenarios
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14998v1.pdf
Summary: Image acquisition conditions and environments can significantly affect high-level tasks in computer vision, and the performance of most computer vision algorithms will be limited when trained on distortion-free datasets. Even with updates in hardware such as sensors and deep learning methods, it will still not work in the face of variable conditions in real-world applications. In this paper, we apply the object detector YOLOv7 to detect distorted images from the dataset CDCOCO. Through carefully designed optimizations including data enhancement, detection box ensemble, denoiser ensemble, super-resolution models, and transfer learning, our model achieves excellent performance on the CDCOCO test set. Our denoising detection model can denoise and repair distorted images, making the model useful in a variety of real-world scenarios and environments.

Model: Online Overexposed Pixels Hallucination in Videos with Adaptive Reference Frame Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15462v1.pdf
Summary: Low dynamic range (LDR) cameras cannot deal with wide dynamic range inputs, frequently leading to local overexposure issues. We present a learning-based system to reduce these artifacts without resorting to complex acquisition mechanisms like alternating exposures or costly processing that are typical of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. We propose a transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) to infer the missing HDR details. In an ablation study, we show the importance of using a multiscale DNN and train it with the proper cost function to achieve state-of-the-art quality. To aid the reconstruction of the overexposed areas, our DNN takes a reference frame from the past as an additional input. This leverages the commonly occurring temporal instabilities of autoexposure to our advantage: since well-exposed details in the current frame may be overexposed in the future, we use reinforcement learning to train a reference frame selection DNN that decides whether to adopt the current frame as a future reference. Without resorting to alternating exposures, we obtain therefore a causal, HDR hallucination algorithm with potential application in common video acquisition settings.
