Model: PIV3CAMS: a multi-camera dataset for multiple computer vision problems and its application to novel view-point synthesis
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18695v1.pdf
Summary: The modern approaches for computer vision tasks significantly rely on machine learning, which requires a large number of quality images. While there is a plethora of image datasets with a single type of images, there is a lack of datasets collected from multiple cameras. In this thesis, we introduce Paired Image and Video data from three CAMeraS, namely PIV3CAMS, aimed at multiple computer vision tasks. The PIV3CAMS dataset consists of 8385 pairs of images and 82 pairs of videos taken from three different cameras: Canon D5 Mark IV, Huawei P20, and ZED stereo camera. The dataset includes various indoor and outdoor scenes from different locations in Zurich (Switzerland) and Cheonan (South Korea). Some of the computer vision applications that can benefit from the PIV3CAMS dataset are image/video enhancement, view interpolation, image matching, and much more. We provide a careful explanation of the data collection process and detailed analysis of the data. The second part of this thesis studies the usage of depth information in the view synthesizing task. In addition to the regeneration of a current state-of-the-art algorithm, we investigate several proposed alternative models that integrate depth information geometrically. Through extensive experiments, we show that the effect of depth is crucial in small view changes. Finally, we apply our model to the introduced PIV3CAMS dataset to synthesize novel target views as an example application of PIV3CAMS.

Model: MultiPly: Reconstruction of Multiple People from Monocular Video in the Wild
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01595v1.pdf
Summary: We present MultiPly, a novel framework to reconstruct multiple people in 3D from monocular in-the-wild videos. Reconstructing multiple individuals moving and interacting naturally from monocular in-the-wild videos poses a challenging task. Addressing it necessitates precise pixel-level disentanglement of individuals without any prior knowledge about the subjects. Moreover, it requires recovering intricate and complete 3D human shapes from short video sequences, intensifying the level of difficulty. To tackle these challenges, we first define a layered neural representation for the entire scene, composited by individual human and background models. We learn the layered neural representation from videos via our layer-wise differentiable volume rendering. This learning process is further enhanced by our hybrid instance segmentation approach which combines the self-supervised 3D segmentation and the promptable 2D segmentation module, yielding reliable instance segmentation supervision even under close human interaction. A confidence-guided optimization formulation is introduced to optimize the human poses and shape/appearance alternately. We incorporate effective objectives to refine human poses via photometric information and impose physically plausible constraints on human dynamics, leading to temporally consistent 3D reconstructions with high fidelity. The evaluation of our method shows the superiority over prior art on publicly available datasets and in-the-wild videos.

Model: Synergistic Global-space Camera and Human Reconstruction from Videos
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14855v1.pdf
Summary: Remarkable strides have been made in reconstructing static scenes or human bodies from monocular videos. Yet, the two problems have largely been approached independently, without much synergy. Most visual SLAM methods can only reconstruct camera trajectories and scene structures up to scale, while most HMR methods reconstruct human meshes in metric scale but fall short in reasoning with cameras and scenes. This work introduces Synergistic Camera and Human Reconstruction (SynCHMR) to marry the best of both worlds. Specifically, we design Human-aware Metric SLAM to reconstruct metric-scale camera poses and scene point clouds using camera-frame HMR as a strong prior, addressing depth, scale, and dynamic ambiguities. Conditioning on the dense scene recovered, we further learn a Scene-aware SMPL Denoiser to enhance world-frame HMR by incorporating spatio-temporal coherency and dynamic scene constraints. Together, they lead to consistent reconstructions of camera trajectories, human meshes, and dense scene point clouds in a common world frame. Project page: https://paulchhuang.github.io/synchmr
