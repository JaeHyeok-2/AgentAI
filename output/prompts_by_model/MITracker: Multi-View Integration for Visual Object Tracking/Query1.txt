You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I tracked a moving person across camera angles, and it kept following them perfectly—even when they went behind objects. How does it stay locked on across views like that?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Walking = Traversable? : Traversability Prediction via Multiple Human Object Tracking under Occlusion
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00242v1.pdf
Summary: The emerging ``Floor plan from human trails (PfH)" technique has great potential for improving indoor robot navigation by predicting the traversability of occluded floors. This study presents an innovative approach that replaces first-person-view sensors with a third-person-view monocular camera mounted on the observer robot. This approach can gather measurements from multiple humans, expanding its range of applications. The key idea is to use two types of trackers, SLAM and MOT, to monitor stationary objects and moving humans and assess their interactions. This method achieves stable predictions of traversability even in challenging visual scenarios, such as occlusions, nonlinear perspectives, depth uncertainty, and intersections involving multiple humans. Additionally, we extend map quality metrics to apply to traversability maps, facilitating future research. We validate our proposed method through fusion and comparison with established techniques.

Model: Lost in Tracking Translation: A Comprehensive Analysis of Visual SLAM in Human-Centered XR and IoT Ecosystems
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07146v1.pdf
Summary: Advancements in tracking algorithms have empowered nascent applications across various domains, from steering autonomous vehicles to guiding robots to enhancing augmented reality experiences for users. However, these algorithms are application-specific and do not work across applications with different types of motion; even a tracking algorithm designed for a given application does not work in scenarios deviating from highly standard conditions. For example, a tracking algorithm designed for robot navigation inside a building will not work for tracking the same robot in an outdoor environment. To demonstrate this problem, we evaluate the performance of the state-of-the-art tracking methods across various applications and scenarios. To inform our analysis, we first categorize algorithmic, environmental, and locomotion-related challenges faced by tracking algorithms. We quantitatively evaluate the performance using multiple tracking algorithms and representative datasets for a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) and Extended Reality (XR) applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, and humans. Our analysis shows that no tracking algorithm works across different applications and scenarios within applications. Ultimately, using the insights generated from our analysis, we discuss multiple approaches to improving the tracking performance using input data characterization, leveraging intermediate information, and output evaluation.

Model: S.T.A.R.-Track: Latent Motion Models for End-to-End 3D Object Tracking with Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Appearance Representations
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17602v3.pdf
Summary: Following the tracking-by-attention paradigm, this paper introduces an object-centric, transformer-based framework for tracking in 3D. Traditional model-based tracking approaches incorporate the geometric effect of object- and ego motion between frames with a geometric motion model. Inspired by this, we propose S.T.A.R.-Track, which uses a novel latent motion model (LMM) to additionally adjust object queries to account for changes in viewing direction and lighting conditions directly in the latent space, while still modeling the geometric motion explicitly. Combined with a novel learnable track embedding that aids in modeling the existence probability of tracks, this results in a generic tracking framework that can be integrated with any query-based detector. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the benefits of our approach, showing state-of-the-art performance for DETR3D-based trackers while drastically reducing the number of identity switches of tracks at the same time.
