You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"Started chatting with it about a complex topic, and it responded with clear, accurate reasoning—almost like talking to an expert. How can a language model think that deeply?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: Despite excelling in high-level reasoning, current language models lack robustness in real-world scenarios and perform poorly on fundamental problem-solving tasks that are intuitive to humans. This paper argues that both challenges stem from a core discrepancy between human and machine cognitive development. While both systems rely on increasing representational power, the absence of core knowledge-foundational cognitive structures in humans-prevents language models from developing robust, generalizable abilities, where complex skills are grounded in simpler ones within their respective domains. It explores empirical evidence of core knowledge in humans, analyzes why language models fail to acquire it, and argues that this limitation is not an inherent architectural constraint. Finally, it outlines a workable proposal for systematically integrating core knowledge into future multi-modal language models through the large-scale generation of synthetic training data using a cognitive prototyping strategy.

Model: Understand User Opinions of Large Language Models via LLM-Powered In-the-Moment User Experience Interviews
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15226v1.pdf
Summary: Which large language model (LLM) is better? Every evaluation tells a story, but what do users really think about current LLMs? This paper presents CLUE, an LLM-powered interviewer that conducts in-the-moment user experience interviews, right after users interact with LLMs, and automatically gathers insights about user opinions from massive interview logs. We conduct a study with thousands of users to understand user opinions on mainstream LLMs, recruiting users to first chat with a target LLM and then be interviewed by CLUE. Our experiments demonstrate that CLUE captures interesting user opinions, e.g., the bipolar views on the displayed reasoning process of DeepSeek-R1 and demands for information freshness and multi-modality.

Model: When Robots Get Chatty: Grounding Multimodal Human-Robot Conversation and Collaboration
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00518v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/pallgeuer/chatty_robots
Summary: We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to equip neural robotic agents with human-like social and cognitive competencies, for the purpose of open-ended human-robot conversation and collaboration. We introduce a modular and extensible methodology for grounding an LLM with the sensory perceptions and capabilities of a physical robot, and integrate multiple deep learning models throughout the architecture in a form of system integration. The integrated models encompass various functions such as speech recognition, speech generation, open-vocabulary object detection, human pose estimation, and gesture detection, with the LLM serving as the central text-based coordinating unit. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the huge potential of LLMs in providing emergent cognition and interactive language-oriented control of robots in a natural and social manner.
