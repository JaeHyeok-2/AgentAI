You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"Even when I switched languages mid-sentence or jumped between topics, it kept up with no problem. What kind of training makes that level of fluency possible?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Large Language Models for Difficulty Estimation of Foreign Language Content with Application to Language Learning
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05142v1.pdf
Summary: We use large language models to aid learners enhance proficiency in a foreign language. This is accomplished by identifying content on topics that the user is interested in, and that closely align with the learner's proficiency level in that foreign language. Our work centers on French content, but our approach is readily transferable to other languages. Our solution offers several distinctive characteristics that differentiate it from existing language-learning solutions, such as, a) the discovery of content across topics that the learner cares about, thus increasing motivation, b) a more precise estimation of the linguistic difficulty of the content than traditional readability measures, and c) the availability of both textual and video-based content. The linguistic complexity of video content is derived from the video captions. It is our aspiration that such technology will enable learners to remain engaged in the language-learning process by continuously adapting the topics and the difficulty of the content to align with the learners' evolving interests and learning objectives.

Model: Can Perplexity Predict Fine-Tuning Performance? An Investigation of Tokenization Effects on Sequential Language Models for Nepali
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18071v1.pdf
Summary: The impact of subword tokenization on language model performance is well-documented for perplexity, with finer granularity consistently reducing this intrinsic metric. However, research on how different tokenization schemes affect a model's understanding capabilities remains limited, particularly for non-Latin script languages. Addressing this gap, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of six distinct tokenization strategies by pretraining transformer-based language models for Nepali and evaluating their performance across multiple downstream tasks. While recent prominent models like GPT, RoBERTa, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, and MPT have adopted byte-level BPE tokenization, our findings demonstrate that for Nepali, SentencePiece tokenization consistently yields superior results on understanding-based tasks. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on BERT-based architectures, our research specifically examines sequential transformer models, providing valuable insights for language model development in low-resource languages and highlighting the importance of tokenization strategy beyond perplexity reduction.

Model: MST5 -- Multilingual Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06041v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/dice-group/MST5
Summary: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) simplifies querying vast amounts of knowledge stored in a graph-based model using natural language. However, the research has largely concentrated on English, putting non-English speakers at a disadvantage. Meanwhile, existing multilingual KGQA systems face challenges in achieving performance comparable to English systems, highlighting the difficulty of generating SPARQL queries from diverse languages. In this research, we propose a simplified approach to enhance multilingual KGQA systems by incorporating linguistic context and entity information directly into the processing pipeline of a language model. Unlike existing methods that rely on separate encoders for integrating auxiliary information, our strategy leverages a single, pretrained multilingual transformer-based language model to manage both the primary input and the auxiliary data. Our methodology significantly improves the language model's ability to accurately convert a natural language query into a relevant SPARQL query. It demonstrates promising results on the most recent QALD datasets, namely QALD-9-Plus and QALD-10. Furthermore, we introduce and evaluate our approach on Chinese and Japanese, thereby expanding the language diversity of the existing datasets.
