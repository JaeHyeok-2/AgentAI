Model: Multi-dataset synergistic in supervised learning to pre-label structural components in point clouds from shell construction scenes
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14721v1.pdf
Summary: The significant effort required to annotate data for new training datasets hinders computer vision research and machine learning in the construction industry. This work explores adapting standard datasets and the latest transformer model architectures for point cloud semantic segmentation in the context of shell construction sites. Unlike common approaches focused on object segmentation of building interiors and furniture, this study addressed the challenges of segmenting complex structural components in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC). We establish a baseline through supervised training and a custom validation dataset, evaluate the cross-domain inference with large-scale indoor datasets, and utilize transfer learning to maximize segmentation performance with minimal new data. The findings indicate that with minimal fine-tuning, pre-trained transformer architectures offer an effective strategy for building component segmentation. Our results are promising for automating the annotation of new, previously unseen data when creating larger training resources and for the segmentation of frequently recurring objects.

Model: A Framework for Building Point Cloud Cleaning, Plane Detection and Semantic Segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00692v2.pdf
Summary: This paper presents a framework to address the challenges involved in building point cloud cleaning, plane detection, and semantic segmentation, with the ultimate goal of enhancing building modeling. We focus in the cleaning stage on removing outliers from the acquired point cloud data by employing an adaptive threshold technique based on z-score measure. Following the cleaning process, we perform plane detection using the robust RANSAC paradigm. The goal is to carry out multiple plane segmentations, and to classify segments into distinct categories, such as floors, ceilings, and walls. The resulting segments can generate accurate and detailed point clouds representing the building's architectural elements. Moreover, we address the problem of semantic segmentation, which plays a vital role in the identification and classification of different components within the building, such as walls, windows, doors, roofs, and objects. Inspired by the PointNet architecture, we propose a deep learning architecture for efficient semantic segmentation in buildings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in handling building modeling tasks, paving the way for improved accuracy and efficiency in the field of building modelization.

Model: ARCH2S: Dataset, Benchmark and Challenges for Learning Exterior Architectural Structures from Point Clouds
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01337v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/Semanticity-Research/ARCH2S
Summary: Precise segmentation of architectural structures provides detailed information about various building components, enhancing our understanding and interaction with our built environment. Nevertheless, existing outdoor 3D point cloud datasets have limited and detailed annotations on architectural exteriors due to privacy concerns and the expensive costs of data acquisition and annotation. To overcome this shortfall, this paper introduces a semantically-enriched, photo-realistic 3D architectural models dataset and benchmark for semantic segmentation. It features 4 different building purposes of real-world buildings as well as an open architectural landscape in Hong Kong. Each point cloud is annotated into one of 14 semantic classes.
