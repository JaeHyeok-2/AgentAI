You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I enlarged a heavily compressed image by 3×, and it still looked impressively clean. How does AI restore such natural-looking detail from low-quality input?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Unified Data-Free Compression: Pruning and Quantization without Fine-Tuning
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07209v1.pdf
Summary: Structured pruning and quantization are promising approaches for reducing the inference time and memory footprint of neural networks. However, most existing methods require the original training dataset to fine-tune the model. This not only brings heavy resource consumption but also is not possible for applications with sensitive or proprietary data due to privacy and security concerns. Therefore, a few data-free methods are proposed to address this problem, but they perform data-free pruning and quantization separately, which does not explore the complementarity of pruning and quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Unified Data-Free Compression(UDFC), which performs pruning and quantization simultaneously without any data and fine-tuning process. Specifically, UDFC starts with the assumption that the partial information of a damaged(e.g., pruned or quantized) channel can be preserved by a linear combination of other channels, and then derives the reconstruction form from the assumption to restore the information loss due to compression. Finally, we formulate the reconstruction error between the original network and its compressed network, and theoretically deduce the closed-form solution. We evaluate the UDFC on the large-scale image classification task and obtain significant improvements over various network architectures and compression methods. For example, we achieve a 20.54% accuracy improvement on ImageNet dataset compared to SOTA method with 30% pruning ratio and 6-bit quantization on ResNet-34.

Model: Deep Selector-JPEG: Adaptive JPEG Image Compression for Computer Vision in Image classification with Human Vision Criteria
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09560v1.pdf
Summary: With limited storage/bandwidth resources, input images to Computer Vision (CV) applications that use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often encoded with JPEG that is tailored to Human Vision (HV). This paper presents Deep Selector-JPEG, an adaptive JPEG compression method that targets image classification while satisfying HV criteria. For each image, Deep Selector-JPEG selects adaptively a Quality Factor (QF) to compress the image so that a good trade-off between the Compression Ratio (CR) and DNN classifier Accuracy (Rate-Accuracy performance) can be achieved over a set of images for a variety of DNN classifiers while the MS-SSIM of such compressed image is greater than a threshold value predetermined by HV with a high probability. Deep Selector-JPEG is designed via light-weighted or heavy-weighted selector architectures. Experimental results show that in comparison with JPEG at the same CR, Deep Selector-JPEG achieves better Rate-Accuracy performance over the ImageNet validation set for all tested DNN classifiers with gains in classification accuracy between 0.2% and 1% at the same CRs while satisfying HV constraints. Deep Selector-JPEG can also roughly provide the original classification accuracy at higher CRs.
