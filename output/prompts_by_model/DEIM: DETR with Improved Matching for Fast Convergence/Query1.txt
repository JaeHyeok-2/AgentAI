Model: On the Importance of Large Objects in CNN Based Object Detection Algorithms
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11714v1.pdf
Summary: Object detection models, a prominent class of machine learning algorithms, aim to identify and precisely locate objects in images or videos. However, this task might yield uneven performances sometimes caused by the objects sizes and the quality of the images and labels used for training. In this paper, we highlight the importance of large objects in learning features that are critical for all sizes. Given these findings, we propose to introduce a weighting term into the training loss. This term is a function of the object area size. We show that giving more weight to large objects leads to improved detection scores across all object sizes and so an overall improvement in Object Detectors performances (+2 p.p. of mAP on small objects, +2 p.p. on medium and +4 p.p. on large on COCO val 2017 with InternImage-T). Additional experiments and ablation studies with different models and on a different dataset further confirm the robustness of our findings.

Model: YOLOv12: Attention-Centric Real-Time Object Detectors
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12524v1.pdf
Summary: Enhancing the network architecture of the YOLO framework has been crucial for a long time, but has focused on CNN-based improvements despite the proven superiority of attention mechanisms in modeling capabilities. This is because attention-based models cannot match the speed of CNN-based models. This paper proposes an attention-centric YOLO framework, namely YOLOv12, that matches the speed of previous CNN-based ones while harnessing the performance benefits of attention mechanisms. YOLOv12 surpasses all popular real-time object detectors in accuracy with competitive speed. For example, YOLOv12-N achieves 40.6% mAP with an inference latency of 1.64 ms on a T4 GPU, outperforming advanced YOLOv10-N / YOLOv11-N by 2.1%/1.2% mAP with a comparable speed. This advantage extends to other model scales. YOLOv12 also surpasses end-to-end real-time detectors that improve DETR, such as RT-DETR / RT-DETRv2: YOLOv12-S beats RT-DETR-R18 / RT-DETRv2-R18 while running 42% faster, using only 36% of the computation and 45% of the parameters. More comparisons are shown in Figure 1.

Model: EffiPerception: an Efficient Framework for Various Perception Tasks
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12317v1.pdf
Summary: The accuracy-speed-memory trade-off is always the priority to consider for several computer vision perception tasks.   Previous methods mainly focus on a single or small couple of these tasks, such as creating effective data augmentation, feature extractor, learning strategies, etc. These approaches, however, could be inherently task-specific: their proposed model's performance may depend on a specific perception task or a dataset.   Targeting to explore common learning patterns and increasing the module robustness, we propose the EffiPerception framework.   It could achieve great accuracy-speed performance with relatively low memory cost under several perception tasks: 2D Object Detection, 3D Object Detection, 2D Instance Segmentation, and 3D Point Cloud Segmentation.   Overall, the framework consists of three parts:   (1) Efficient Feature Extractors, which extract the input features for each modality. (2) Efficient Layers, plug-in plug-out layers that further process the feature representation, aggregating core learned information while pruning noisy proposals. (3) The EffiOptim, an 8-bit optimizer to further cut down the computational cost and facilitate performance stability.   Extensive experiments on the KITTI, semantic-KITTI, and COCO datasets revealed that EffiPerception could show great accuracy-speed-memory overall performance increase within the four detection and segmentation tasks, in comparison to earlier, well-respected methods.
