Model: A Little Bit Attention Is All You Need for Person Re-Identification

Summary: Person re-identification plays a key role in applications where a mobile robot needs to track its users over a long period of time, even if they are partially unobserved for some time, in order to follow them or be available on demand. In this context, deep-learning based real-time feature extraction on a mobile robot is often performed on special-purpose devices whose computational resources are shared for multiple tasks. Therefore, the inference speed has to be taken into account. In contrast, person re-identification is often improved by architectural changes that come at the cost of significantly slowing down inference. Attention blocks are one such example. We will show that some well-performing attention blocks used in the state of the art are subject to inference costs that are far too high to justify their use for mobile robotic applications. As a consequence, we propose an attention block that only slightly affects the inference speed while keeping up with much deeper networks or more complex attention blocks in terms of re-identification accuracy. We perform extensive neural architecture search to derive rules at which locations this attention block should be integrated into the architecture in order to achieve the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. Finally, we confirm that the best performing configuration on a re-identification benchmark also performs well on an indoor robotic dataset.

Model: IMP: Iterative Matching and Pose Estimation with Adaptive Pooling
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14837v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/feixue94/imp-release
Summary: Previous methods solve feature matching and pose estimation using a two-stage process by first finding matches and then estimating the pose. As they ignore the geometric relationships between the two tasks, they focus on either improving the quality of matches or filtering potential outliers, leading to limited efficiency or accuracy. In contrast, we propose an iterative matching and pose estimation framework (IMP) leveraging the geometric connections between the two tasks: a few good matches are enough for a roughly accurate pose estimation; a roughly accurate pose can be used to guide the matching by providing geometric constraints. To this end, we implement a geometry-aware recurrent attention-based module which jointly outputs sparse matches and camera poses. Specifically, for each iteration, we first implicitly embed geometric information into the module via a pose-consistency loss, allowing it to predict geometry-aware matches progressively. Second, we introduce an \textbf{e}fficient IMP, called EIMP, to dynamically discard keypoints without potential matches, avoiding redundant updating and significantly reducing the quadratic time complexity of attention computation in transformers. Experiments on YFCC100m, Scannet, and Aachen Day-Night datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Model: Dynamic Patch-aware Enrichment Transformer for Occluded Person Re-Identification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10435v1.pdf
Summary: Person re-identification (re-ID) continues to pose a significant challenge, particularly in scenarios involving occlusions. Prior approaches aimed at tackling occlusions have predominantly focused on aligning physical body features through the utilization of external semantic cues. However, these methods tend to be intricate and susceptible to noise. To address the aforementioned challenges, we present an innovative end-to-end solution known as the Dynamic Patch-aware Enrichment Transformer (DPEFormer). This model effectively distinguishes human body information from occlusions automatically and dynamically, eliminating the need for external detectors or precise image alignment. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic patch token selection module (DPSM). DPSM utilizes a label-guided proxy token as an intermediary to identify informative occlusion-free tokens. These tokens are then selected for deriving subsequent local part features. To facilitate the seamless integration of global classification features with the finely detailed local features selected by DPSM, we introduce a novel feature blending module (FBM). FBM enhances feature representation through the complementary nature of information and the exploitation of part diversity. Furthermore, to ensure that DPSM and the entire DPEFormer can effectively learn with only identity labels, we also propose a Realistic Occlusion Augmentation (ROA) strategy. This strategy leverages the recent advances in the Segment Anything Model (SAM). As a result, it generates occlusion images that closely resemble real-world occlusions, greatly enhancing the subsequent contrastive learning process. Experiments on occluded and holistic re-ID benchmarks signify a substantial advancement of DPEFormer over existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code will be made publicly available.
