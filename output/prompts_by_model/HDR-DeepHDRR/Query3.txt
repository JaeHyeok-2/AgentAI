Model: A-BDD: Leveraging Data Augmentations for Safe Autonomous Driving in Adverse Weather and Lighting
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06071v2.pdf
Summary: High-autonomy vehicle functions rely on machine learning (ML) algorithms to understand the environment. Despite displaying remarkable performance in fair weather scenarios, perception algorithms are heavily affected by adverse weather and lighting conditions. To overcome these difficulties, ML engineers mainly rely on comprehensive real-world datasets. However, the difficulties in real-world data collection for critical areas of the operational design domain (ODD) often means synthetic data is required for perception training and safety validation. Thus, we present A-BDD, a large set of over 60,000 synthetically augmented images based on BDD100K that are equipped with semantic segmentation and bounding box annotations (inherited from the BDD100K dataset). The dataset contains augmented data for rain, fog, overcast and sunglare/shadow with varying intensity levels. We further introduce novel strategies utilizing feature-based image quality metrics like FID and CMMD, which help identify useful augmented and real-world data for ML training and testing. By conducting experiments on A-BDD, we provide evidence that data augmentations can play a pivotal role in closing performance gaps in adverse weather and lighting conditions.

Model: ALEN: A Dual-Approach for Uniform and Non-Uniform Low-Light Image Enhancement
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19708v4.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/xingyumex/alen
Summary: Low-light image enhancement is an important task in computer vision, essential for improving the visibility and quality of images captured in non-optimal lighting conditions. Inadequate illumination can lead to significant information loss and poor image quality, impacting various applications such as surveillance. photography, or even autonomous driving. In this regard, automated methods have been developed to automatically adjust illumination in the image for a better visual perception. Current enhancement techniques often use specific datasets to enhance low-light images, but still present challenges when adapting to diverse real-world conditions, where illumination degradation may be localized to specific regions. To address this challenge, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, whose main approach is the use of a classification mechanism to determine whether local or global illumination enhancement is required. Subsequently, estimator networks adjust illumination based on this classification and simultaneously enhance color fidelity. ALEN integrates the Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization, complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet), and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise estimation of illumination and color, respectively. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for low-light conditions were carried out to underscore ALEN's robust generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The ALEN not only enhances image quality in terms of visual perception but also represents an advancement in high-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, as presented in this work. The code of this method is available at https://github.com/xingyumex/ALEN

Model: Quaternion-Hadamard Network: A Novel Defense Against Adversarial Attacks with a New Dataset
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10452v1.pdf
Summary: This paper addresses the vulnerability of deep-learning models designed for rain, snow, and haze removal. Despite enhancing image quality in adverse weather, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise their effectiveness. Traditional defenses such as adversarial training and model distillation often require extensive retraining, making them costly and impractical for real-world deployment. While denoising and super-resolution techniques can aid image classification models, they impose high computational demands and introduce visual artifacts that hinder image processing tasks. We propose a model-agnostic defense against first-order white-box adversarial attacks using the Quaternion-Hadamard Network (QHNet) to tackle these challenges. White-box attacks are particularly difficult to defend against since attackers have full access to the model's architecture, weights, and training procedures. Our defense introduces the Quaternion Hadamard Denoising Convolutional Block (QHDCB) and the Quaternion Denoising Residual Block (QDRB), leveraging polynomial thresholding. QHNet incorporates these blocks within an encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by feature refinement, to effectively neutralize adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce the Adversarial Weather Conditions Vision Dataset (AWCVD), created by applying first-order gradient attacks on state-of-the-art weather removal techniques in scenarios involving haze, rain streaks, and snow. Using PSNR and SSIM metrics, we demonstrate that QHNet significantly enhances the robustness of low-level computer vision models against adversarial attacks compared with state-of-the-art denoising and super-resolution techniques. The source code and dataset will be released alongside the final version of this paper.
