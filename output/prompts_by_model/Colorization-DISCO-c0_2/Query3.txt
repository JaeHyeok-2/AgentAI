Model: DreamColour: Controllable Video Colour Editing without Training
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05180v1.pdf
Summary: Video colour editing is a crucial task for content creation, yet existing solutions either require painstaking frame-by-frame manipulation or produce unrealistic results with temporal artefacts. We present a practical, training-free framework that makes precise video colour editing accessible through an intuitive interface while maintaining professional-quality output. Our key insight is that by decoupling spatial and temporal aspects of colour editing, we can better align with users' natural workflow -- allowing them to focus on precise colour selection in key frames before automatically propagating changes across time. We achieve this through a novel technical framework that combines: (i) a simple point-and-click interface merging grid-based colour selection with automatic instance segmentation for precise spatial control, (ii) bidirectional colour propagation that leverages inherent video motion patterns, and (iii) motion-aware blending that ensures smooth transitions even with complex object movements. Through extensive evaluation on diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods while eliminating the need for training or specialized hardware, making professional-quality video colour editing accessible to everyone.

Model: CamCo: Camera-Controllable 3D-Consistent Image-to-Video Generation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02509v1.pdf
Summary: Recently video diffusion models have emerged as expressive generative tools for high-quality video content creation readily available to general users. However, these models often do not offer precise control over camera poses for video generation, limiting the expression of cinematic language and user control. To address this issue, we introduce CamCo, which allows fine-grained Camera pose Control for image-to-video generation. We equip a pre-trained image-to-video generator with accurately parameterized camera pose input using Pl\"ucker coordinates. To enhance 3D consistency in the videos produced, we integrate an epipolar attention module in each attention block that enforces epipolar constraints to the feature maps. Additionally, we fine-tune CamCo on real-world videos with camera poses estimated through structure-from-motion algorithms to better synthesize object motion. Our experiments show that CamCo significantly improves 3D consistency and camera control capabilities compared to previous models while effectively generating plausible object motion.

Model: A Learnable Color Correction Matrix for RAW Reconstruction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02497v1.pdf
Summary: Autonomous driving algorithms usually employ sRGB images as model input due to their compatibility with the human visual system. However, visually pleasing sRGB images are possibly sub-optimal for downstream tasks when compared to RAW images. The availability of RAW images is constrained by the difficulties in collecting real-world driving data and the associated challenges of annotation. To address this limitation and support research in RAW-domain driving perception, we design a novel and ultra-lightweight RAW reconstruction method. The proposed model introduces a learnable color correction matrix (CCM), which uses only a single convolutional layer to approximate the complex inverse image signal processor (ISP). Experimental results demonstrate that simulated RAW (simRAW) images generated by our method provide performance improvements equivalent to those produced by more complex inverse ISP methods when pretraining RAW-domain object detectors, which highlights the effectiveness and practicality of our approach.
