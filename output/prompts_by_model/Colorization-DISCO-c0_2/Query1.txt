You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I colorized the same black-and-white portrait several times, and the hair or clothing colors came out differently each time—sometimes brown, sometimes blue. How can AI offer such varied yet plausible results from the same input? Is this randomness part of the design?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: Generative AIs produce creative outputs in the style of human expression. We argue that encounters with the outputs of modern generative AI models are mediated by the same kinds of aesthetic judgments that organize our interactions with artwork. The interpretation procedure we use on art we find in museums is not an innate human faculty, but one developed over history by disciplines such as art history and art criticism to fulfill certain social functions. This gives us pause when considering our reactions to generative AI, how we should approach this new medium, and why generative AI seems to incite so much fear about the future. We naturally inherit a conundrum of causal inference from the history of art: a work can be read as a symptom of the cultural conditions that influenced its creation while simultaneously being framed as a timeless, seemingly acausal distillation of an eternal human condition. In this essay, we focus on an unresolved tension when we bring this dilemma to bear in the context of generative AI: are we looking for proof that generated media reflects something about the conditions that created it or some eternal human essence? Are current modes of interpretation sufficient for this task? Historically, new forms of art have changed how art is interpreted, with such influence used as evidence that a work of art has touched some essential human truth. As generative AI influences contemporary aesthetic judgment we outline some of the pitfalls and traps in attempting to scrutinize what AI generated media means.

Model: WSAM: Visual Explanations from Style Augmentation as Adversarial Attacker and Their Influence in Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14995v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/fmorenovr/WSAM_Style
Summary: Currently, style augmentation is capturing attention due to convolutional neural networks (CNN) being strongly biased toward recognizing textures rather than shapes. Most existing styling methods either perform a low-fidelity style transfer or a weak style representation in the embedding vector. This paper outlines a style augmentation algorithm using stochastic-based sampling with noise addition to improving randomization on a general linear transformation for style transfer. With our augmentation strategy, all models not only present incredible robustness against image stylizing but also outperform all previous methods and surpass the state-of-the-art performance for the STL-10 dataset. In addition, we present an analysis of the model interpretations under different style variations. At the same time, we compare comprehensive experiments demonstrating the performance when applied to deep neural architectures in training settings.

Model: Diversify Question Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Style Transfer
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14503v1.pdf

Summary: Given a textual passage and an answer, humans are able to ask questions with various expressions, but this ability is still challenging for most question generation (QG) systems. Existing solutions mainly focus on the internal knowledge within the given passage or the semantic word space for diverse content planning. These methods, however, have not considered the potential of external knowledge for expression diversity. To bridge this gap, we propose RAST, a framework for Retrieval-Augmented Style Transfer, where the objective is to utilize the style of diverse templates for question generation. For training RAST, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach that maximizes a weighted combination of diversity reward and consistency reward. Here, the consistency reward is computed by a Question-Answering (QA) model, whereas the diversity reward measures how much the final output mimics the retrieved template. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous diversity-driven baselines on diversity while being comparable in terms of consistency scores. Our code is available at https://github.com/gouqi666/RAST.
