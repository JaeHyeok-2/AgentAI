You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I used AI to colorize historical black-and-white photos, and I noticed some elements were colored very realistically, while others seemed arbitrary. How does the AI determine what colors to assign, and why are some colors highly realistic while others appear random? What type of data is usually used to train these colorization models?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Control Color: Multimodal Diffusion-based Interactive Image Colorization
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10855v1.pdf
Summary: Despite the existence of numerous colorization methods, several limitations still exist, such as lack of user interaction, inflexibility in local colorization, unnatural color rendering, insufficient color variation, and color overflow. To solve these issues, we introduce Control Color (CtrlColor), a multi-modal colorization method that leverages the pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model, offering promising capabilities in highly controllable interactive image colorization. While several diffusion-based methods have been proposed, supporting colorization in multiple modalities remains non-trivial. In this study, we aim to tackle both unconditional and conditional image colorization (text prompts, strokes, exemplars) and address color overflow and incorrect color within a unified framework. Specifically, we present an effective way to encode user strokes to enable precise local color manipulation and employ a practical way to constrain the color distribution similar to exemplars. Apart from accepting text prompts as conditions, these designs add versatility to our approach. We also introduce a novel module based on self-attention and a content-guided deformable autoencoder to address the long-standing issues of color overflow and inaccurate coloring. Extensive comparisons show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art image colorization methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Model: A Learnable Color Correction Matrix for RAW Reconstruction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02497v1.pdf
Summary: Autonomous driving algorithms usually employ sRGB images as model input due to their compatibility with the human visual system. However, visually pleasing sRGB images are possibly sub-optimal for downstream tasks when compared to RAW images. The availability of RAW images is constrained by the difficulties in collecting real-world driving data and the associated challenges of annotation. To address this limitation and support research in RAW-domain driving perception, we design a novel and ultra-lightweight RAW reconstruction method. The proposed model introduces a learnable color correction matrix (CCM), which uses only a single convolutional layer to approximate the complex inverse image signal processor (ISP). Experimental results demonstrate that simulated RAW (simRAW) images generated by our method provide performance improvements equivalent to those produced by more complex inverse ISP methods when pretraining RAW-domain object detectors, which highlights the effectiveness and practicality of our approach.

Model: REAL: Realism Evaluation of Text-to-Image Generation Models for Effective Data Augmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10663v1.pdf
Summary: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation models have transformed the field. However, challenges persist in generating images that reflect demanding textual descriptions, especially for fine-grained details and unusual relationships. Existing evaluation metrics focus on text-image alignment but overlook the realism of the generated image, which can be crucial for downstream applications like data augmentation in machine learning. To address this gap, we propose REAL, an automatic evaluation framework that assesses realism of T2I outputs along three dimensions: fine-grained visual attributes, unusual visual relationships, and visual styles. REAL achieves a Spearman's rho score of up to 0.62 in alignment with human judgement and demonstrates utility in ranking and filtering augmented data for tasks like image captioning, classification, and visual relationship detection. Empirical results show that high-scoring images evaluated by our metrics improve F1 scores of image classification by up to 11.3%, while low-scoring ones degrade that by up to 4.95%. We benchmark four major T2I models across the realism dimensions, providing insights for future improvements in T2I output realism.
