Model: Crowd-Sourced NeRF: Collecting Data from Production Vehicles for 3D Street View Reconstruction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16289v1.pdf
Summary: Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis. Block-NeRF showed the capability of leveraging NeRF to build large city-scale models. For large-scale modeling, a mass of image data is necessary. Collecting images from specially designed data-collection vehicles can not support large-scale applications. How to acquire massive high-quality data remains an opening problem. Noting that the automotive industry has a huge amount of image data, crowd-sourcing is a convenient way for large-scale data collection. In this paper, we present a crowd-sourced framework, which utilizes substantial data captured by production vehicles to reconstruct the scene with the NeRF model. This approach solves the key problem of large-scale reconstruction, that is where the data comes from and how to use them. Firstly, the crowd-sourced massive data is filtered to remove redundancy and keep a balanced distribution in terms of time and space. Then a structure-from-motion module is performed to refine camera poses. Finally, images, as well as poses, are used to train the NeRF model in a certain block. We highlight that we present a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple modules, including data selection, sparse 3D reconstruction, sequence appearance embedding, depth supervision of ground surface, and occlusion completion. The complete system is capable of effectively processing and reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from crowd-sourced data. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of our system. Moreover, we proposed an application, named first-view navigation, which leveraged the NeRF model to generate 3D street view and guide the driver with a synthesized video.

Model: NeRF2Points: Large-Scale Point Cloud Generation From Street Views' Radiance Field Optimization
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04875v1.pdf
Summary: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a paradigm-shifting methodology for the photorealistic rendering of objects and environments, enabling the synthesis of novel viewpoints with remarkable fidelity. This is accomplished through the strategic utilization of object-centric camera poses characterized by significant inter-frame overlap. This paper explores a compelling, alternative utility of NeRF: the derivation of point clouds from aggregated urban landscape imagery. The transmutation of street-view data into point clouds is fraught with complexities, attributable to a nexus of interdependent variables. First, high-quality point cloud generation hinges on precise camera poses, yet many datasets suffer from inaccuracies in pose metadata. Also, the standard approach of NeRF is ill-suited for the distinct characteristics of street-view data from autonomous vehicles in vast, open settings. Autonomous vehicle cameras often record with limited overlap, leading to blurring, artifacts, and compromised pavement representation in NeRF-based point clouds. In this paper, we present NeRF2Points, a tailored NeRF variant for urban point cloud synthesis, notable for its high-quality output from RGB inputs alone. Our paper is supported by a bespoke, high-resolution 20-kilometer urban street dataset, designed for point cloud generation and evaluation. NeRF2Points adeptly navigates the inherent challenges of NeRF-based point cloud synthesis through the implementation of the following strategic innovations: (1) Integration of Weighted Iterative Geometric Optimization (WIGO) and Structure from Motion (SfM) for enhanced camera pose accuracy, elevating street-view data precision. (2) Layered Perception and Integrated Modeling (LPiM) is designed for distinct radiance field modeling in urban environments, resulting in coherent point cloud representations.
