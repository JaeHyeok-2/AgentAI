Summary: Increasing the accuracy of instance segmentation methods is often done at the expense of speed. Using coarser representations, we can reduce the number of parameters and thus obtain real-time masks. In this paper, we take inspiration from the set cover problem to predict mask approximations. Given ground-truth binary masks of objects of interest as training input, our method learns to predict the approximate coverage of these objects by disks without supervision on their location or radius. Each object is represented by a fixed number of disks with different radii. In the learning phase, we consider the radius as proportional to a standard deviation in order to compute the error to propagate on a set of two-dimensional Gaussian functions rather than disks. We trained and tested our instance segmentation method on challenging datasets showing dense urban settings with various road users. Our method achieve state-of-the art results on the IDD and KITTI dataset with an inference time of 0.040 s on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

Model: PatchDCT: Patch Refinement for High Quality Instance Segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02693v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/olivia-w12/patchdct
Summary: High-quality instance segmentation has shown emerging importance in computer vision. Without any refinement, DCT-Mask directly generates high-resolution masks by compressed vectors. To further refine masks obtained by compressed vectors, we propose for the first time a compressed vector based multi-stage refinement framework. However, the vanilla combination does not bring significant gains, because changes in some elements of the DCT vector will affect the prediction of the entire mask. Thus, we propose a simple and novel method named PatchDCT, which separates the mask decoded from a DCT vector into several patches and refines each patch by the designed classifier and regressor. Specifically, the classifier is used to distinguish mixed patches from all patches, and to correct previously mispredicted foreground and background patches. In contrast, the regressor is used for DCT vector prediction of mixed patches, further refining the segmentation quality at boundary locations. Experiments on COCO show that our method achieves 2.0%, 3.2%, 4.5% AP and 3.4%, 5.3%, 7.0% Boundary AP improvements over Mask-RCNN on COCO, LVIS, and Cityscapes, respectively. It also surpasses DCT-Mask by 0.7%, 1.1%, 1.3% AP and 0.9%, 1.7%, 4.2% Boundary AP on COCO, LVIS and Cityscapes. Besides, the performance of PatchDCT is also competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.

Model: SortedAP: Rethinking evaluation metrics for instance segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04887v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/looooongchen/sortedap
Summary: Designing metrics for evaluating instance segmentation revolves around comprehensively considering object detection and segmentation accuracy. However, other important properties, such as sensitivity, continuity, and equality, are overlooked in the current study. In this paper, we reveal that most existing metrics have a limited resolution of segmentation quality. They are only conditionally sensitive to the change of masks or false predictions. For certain metrics, the score can change drastically in a narrow range which could provide a misleading indication of the quality gap between results. Therefore, we propose a new metric called sortedAP, which strictly decreases with both object- and pixel-level imperfections and has an uninterrupted penalization scale over the entire domain. We provide the evaluation toolkit and experiment code at https://www.github.com/looooongChen/sortedAP.
