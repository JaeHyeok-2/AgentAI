Model: Spatially-Adaptive Feature Modulation for Efficient Image Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13800v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/sunny2109/safmn
Summary: Although numerous solutions have been proposed for image super-resolution, they are usually incompatible with low-power devices with many computational and memory constraints. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a simple yet effective deep network to solve image super-resolution efficiently. In detail, we develop a spatially-adaptive feature modulation (SAFM) mechanism upon a vision transformer (ViT)-like block. Within it, we first apply the SAFM block over input features to dynamically select representative feature representations. As the SAFM block processes the input features from a long-range perspective, we further introduce a convolutional channel mixer (CCM) to simultaneously extract local contextual information and perform channel mixing. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is $3\times$ smaller than state-of-the-art efficient SR methods, e.g., IMDN, in terms of the network parameters and requires less computational cost while achieving comparable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/sunny2109/SAFMN.

Model: A Study in Dataset Distillation for Image Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03656v1.pdf
Summary: Dataset distillation is the concept of condensing large datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While previous research has primarily focused on image classification, its application to image Super-Resolution (SR) remains underexplored. This exploratory work studies multiple dataset distillation techniques applied to SR, including pixel- and latent-space approaches under different aspects. Our experiments demonstrate that a 91.12% dataset size reduction can be achieved while maintaining comparable SR performance to the full dataset. We further analyze initialization strategies and distillation methods to optimize memory efficiency and computational costs. Our findings provide new insights into dataset distillation for SR and set the stage for future advancements.

Model: CausalSR: Structural Causal Model-Driven Super-Resolution with Counterfactual Inference
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15852v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/Mnster00/CasualSR
Summary: Physical and optical factors interacting with sensor characteristics create complex image degradation patterns. Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.
