You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I tried summarizing different types of articles, and the AI somehow always caught the main point—even if it was hidden halfway through. How does it manage to scan the whole structure and still pick out the core message?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: GraphLSS: Integrating Lexical, Structural, and Semantic Features for Long Document Extractive Summarization
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21315v1.pdf
Summary: Heterogeneous graph neural networks have recently gained attention for long document summarization, modeling the extraction as a node classification task. Although effective, these models often require external tools or additional machine learning models to define graph components, producing highly complex and less intuitive structures. We present GraphLSS, a heterogeneous graph construction for long document extractive summarization, incorporating Lexical, Structural, and Semantic features. It defines two levels of information (words and sentences) and four types of edges (sentence semantic similarity, sentence occurrence order, word in sentence, and word semantic similarity) without any need for auxiliary learning models. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that GraphLSS is competitive with top-performing graph-based methods, outperforming recent non-graph models. We release our code on GitHub.

Model: Dissecting Recall of Factual Associations in Auto-Regressive Language Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14767v3.pdf
Summary: Transformer-based language models (LMs) are known to capture factual knowledge in their parameters. While previous work looked into where factual associations are stored, only little is known about how they are retrieved internally during inference. We investigate this question through the lens of information flow. Given a subject-relation query, we study how the model aggregates information about the subject and relation to predict the correct attribute. With interventions on attention edges, we first identify two critical points where information propagates to the prediction: one from the relation positions followed by another from the subject positions. Next, by analyzing the information at these points, we unveil a three-step internal mechanism for attribute extraction. First, the representation at the last-subject position goes through an enrichment process, driven by the early MLP sublayers, to encode many subject-related attributes. Second, information from the relation propagates to the prediction. Third, the prediction representation "queries" the enriched subject to extract the attribute. Perhaps surprisingly, this extraction is typically done via attention heads, which often encode subject-attribute mappings in their parameters. Overall, our findings introduce a comprehensive view of how factual associations are stored and extracted internally in LMs, facilitating future research on knowledge localization and editing.

Model: DocTr: Document Transformer for Structured Information Extraction in Documents
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07929v1.pdf
Summary: We present a new formulation for structured information extraction (SIE) from visually rich documents. It aims to address the limitations of existing IOB tagging or graph-based formulations, which are either overly reliant on the correct ordering of input text or struggle with decoding a complex graph. Instead, motivated by anchor-based object detectors in vision, we represent an entity as an anchor word and a bounding box, and represent entity linking as the association between anchor words. This is more robust to text ordering, and maintains a compact graph for entity linking. The formulation motivates us to introduce 1) a DOCument TRansformer (DocTr) that aims at detecting and associating entity bounding boxes in visually rich documents, and 2) a simple pre-training strategy that helps learn entity detection in the context of language. Evaluations on three SIE benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed formulation, and the overall approach outperforms existing solutions.
