You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I pasted in a messy, unstructured draft, but the summary came out surprisingly clear and focused. How does the model reorganize disjointed content and identify what matters most?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16868v1.pdf
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and autonomous AI agent workflows. Yet, when faced with large sets of unstructured documents requiring progressive exploration, analysis, and synthesis, such as conducting literature survey, existing approaches often fall short. We address this challenge -- termed Progressive Document Investigation -- by introducing Graphy, an end-to-end platform that automates data modeling, exploration and high-quality report generation in a user-friendly manner. Graphy comprises an offline Scrapper that transforms raw documents into a structured graph of Fact and Dimension nodes, and an online Surveyor that enables iterative exploration and LLM-driven report generation. We showcase a pre-scrapped graph of over 50,000 papers -- complete with their references -- demonstrating how Graphy facilitates the literature-survey scenario.

Model: Dissecting Recall of Factual Associations in Auto-Regressive Language Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14767v3.pdf
Summary: Transformer-based language models (LMs) are known to capture factual knowledge in their parameters. While previous work looked into where factual associations are stored, only little is known about how they are retrieved internally during inference. We investigate this question through the lens of information flow. Given a subject-relation query, we study how the model aggregates information about the subject and relation to predict the correct attribute. With interventions on attention edges, we first identify two critical points where information propagates to the prediction: one from the relation positions followed by another from the subject positions. Next, by analyzing the information at these points, we unveil a three-step internal mechanism for attribute extraction. First, the representation at the last-subject position goes through an enrichment process, driven by the early MLP sublayers, to encode many subject-related attributes. Second, information from the relation propagates to the prediction. Third, the prediction representation "queries" the enriched subject to extract the attribute. Perhaps surprisingly, this extraction is typically done via attention heads, which often encode subject-attribute mappings in their parameters. Overall, our findings introduce a comprehensive view of how factual associations are stored and extracted internally in LMs, facilitating future research on knowledge localization and editing.

Model: Collage: Decomposable Rapid Prototyping for Information Extraction on Scientific PDFs
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23478v1.pdf

Summary: Recent years in NLP have seen the continued development of domain-specific information extraction tools for scientific documents, alongside the release of increasingly multimodal pretrained transformer models. While the opportunity for scientists outside of NLP to evaluate and apply such systems to their own domains has never been clearer, these models are difficult to compare: they accept different input formats, are often black-box and give little insight into processing failures, and rarely handle PDF documents, the most common format of scientific publication. In this work, we present Collage, a tool designed for rapid prototyping, visualization, and evaluation of different information extraction models on scientific PDFs. Collage allows the use and evaluation of any HuggingFace token classifier, several LLMs, and multiple other task-specific models out of the box, and provides extensible software interfaces to accelerate experimentation with new models. Further, we enable both developers and users of NLP-based tools to inspect, debug, and better understand modeling pipelines by providing granular views of intermediate states of processing. We demonstrate our system in the context of information extraction to assist with literature review in materials science.
