You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I dropped in an image of a sunset, and it instantly found poems and captions that perfectly matched the mood. How does it connect images and text like that?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Model: Constructing Image-Text Pair Dataset from Books
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01936v1.pdf
Summary: Digital archiving is becoming widespread owing to its effectiveness in protecting valuable books and providing knowledge to many people electronically. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to leverage digital archives for machine learning. If we can fully utilize such digitized data, machine learning has the potential to uncover unknown insights and ultimately acquire knowledge autonomously, just like humans read books. As a first step, we design a dataset construction pipeline comprising an optical character reader (OCR), an object detector, and a layout analyzer for the autonomous extraction of image-text pairs. In our experiments, we apply our pipeline on old photo books to construct an image-text pair dataset, showing its effectiveness in image-text retrieval and insight extraction.

Model: Composite Sketch+Text Queries for Retrieving Objects with Elusive Names and Complex Interactions
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08438v1.pdf
Summary: Non-native speakers with limited vocabulary often struggle to name specific objects despite being able to visualize them, e.g., people outside Australia searching for numbats. Further, users may want to search for such elusive objects with difficult-to-sketch interactions, e.g., numbat digging in the ground. In such common but complex situations, users desire a search interface that accepts composite multimodal queries comprising hand-drawn sketches of difficult-to-name but easy-to-draw objects and text describing difficult-to-sketch but easy-to-verbalize object attributes or interaction with the scene. This novel problem statement distinctly differs from the previously well-researched TBIR (text-based image retrieval) and SBIR (sketch-based image retrieval) problems. To study this under-explored task, we curate a dataset, CSTBIR (Composite Sketch+Text Based Image Retrieval), consisting of approx. 2M queries and 108K natural scene images. Further, as a solution to this problem, we propose a pretrained multimodal transformer-based baseline, STNET (Sketch+Text Network), that uses a hand-drawn sketch to localize relevant objects in the natural scene image, and encodes the text and image to perform image retrieval. In addition to contrastive learning, we propose multiple training objectives that improve the performance of our model. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art retrieval methods for text-only, sketch-only, and composite query modalities. We make the dataset and code available at our project website.

Model: PhotoBot: Reference-Guided Interactive Photography via Natural Language
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11061v4.pdf
Summary: We introduce PhotoBot, a framework for fully automated photo acquisition based on an interplay between high-level human language guidance and a robot photographer. We propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via reference images that are selected from a curated gallery. We leverage a visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize the reference images via textual descriptions and then use a large language model (LLM) to retrieve relevant reference images based on a user's language query through text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference image and the observed scene, we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing semantic similarity across marked appearance variations. Using these features, we compute suggested pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach using a manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by users themselves, as measured by human feedback. We also show that PhotoBot can generalize to other reference sources such as paintings.
