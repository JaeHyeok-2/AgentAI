You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I searched using a picture, and it brought back text descriptions that really understood what was in the photo. How can it understand both text and images?"

Summary: Image to image matching has been well studied in the computer vision community. Previous studies mainly focus on training a deep metric learning model matching visual patterns between the query image and gallery images. In this study, we show that pure image-to-image matching suffers from false positives caused by matching to local visual patterns. To alleviate this issue, we propose to leverage recent advances in vision-language pretraining research. Specifically, we introduce additional image-text alignment losses into deep metric learning, which serve as constraints to the image-to-image matching loss. With additional alignments between the text (e.g., product title) and image pairs, the model can learn concepts from both modalities explicitly, which avoids matching low-level visual features. We progressively develop two variants, a 3-tower and a 4-tower model, where the latter takes one more short text query input. Through extensive experiments, we show that this change leads to a substantial improvement to the image to image matching problem. We further leveraged this model for multimodal search, which takes both image and reformulation text queries to improve search quality. Both offline and online experiments show strong improvements on the main metrics. Specifically, we see 4.95% relative improvement on image matching click through rate with the 3-tower model and 1.13% further improvement from the 4-tower model.

Model: Rethinking Sparse Lexical Representations for Image Retrieval in the Age of Rising Multi-Modal Large Language Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16296v1.pdf
Summary: In this paper, we rethink sparse lexical representations for image retrieval. By utilizing multi-modal large language models (M-LLMs) that support visual prompting, we can extract image features and convert them into textual data, enabling us to utilize efficient sparse retrieval algorithms employed in natural language processing for image retrieval tasks. To assist the LLM in extracting image features, we apply data augmentation techniques for key expansion and analyze the impact with a metric for relevance between images and textual data. We empirically show the superior precision and recall performance of our image retrieval method compared to conventional vision-language model-based methods on the MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, and NUS-WIDE datasets in a keyword-based image retrieval scenario, where keywords serve as search queries. We also demonstrate that the retrieval performance can be improved by iteratively incorporating keywords into search queries.

Model: Constructing Image-Text Pair Dataset from Books
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01936v1.pdf
Summary: Digital archiving is becoming widespread owing to its effectiveness in protecting valuable books and providing knowledge to many people electronically. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to leverage digital archives for machine learning. If we can fully utilize such digitized data, machine learning has the potential to uncover unknown insights and ultimately acquire knowledge autonomously, just like humans read books. As a first step, we design a dataset construction pipeline comprising an optical character reader (OCR), an object detector, and a layout analyzer for the autonomous extraction of image-text pairs. In our experiments, we apply our pipeline on old photo books to construct an image-text pair dataset, showing its effectiveness in image-text retrieval and insight extraction.
