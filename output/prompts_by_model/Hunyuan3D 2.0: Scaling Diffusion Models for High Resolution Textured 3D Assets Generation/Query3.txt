Model: DreamDrone: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models are Zero-shot Perpetual View Generators
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08746v3.pdf
Summary: We introduce DreamDrone, a novel zero-shot and training-free pipeline for generating unbounded flythrough scenes from textual prompts. Different from other methods that focus on warping images frame by frame, we advocate explicitly warping the intermediate latent code of the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for high-quality image generation and generalization ability. To further enhance the fidelity of the generated images, we also propose a feature-correspondence-guidance diffusion process and a high-pass filtering strategy to promote geometric consistency and high-frequency detail consistency, respectively. Extensive experiments reveal that DreamDrone significantly surpasses existing methods, delivering highly authentic scene generation with exceptional visual quality, without training or fine-tuning on datasets or reconstructing 3D point clouds in advance.

Model: MUSES: 3D-Controllable Image Generation via Multi-Modal Agent Collaboration
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10605v5.pdf

Summary: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, most existing methods struggle to create images with multiple objects and complex spatial relationships in the 3D world. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI system, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries. Specifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a progressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager for 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and calibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the collaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline facilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable objects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up generation. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed descriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill this gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image scene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts. Extensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both T2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant step of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D world.
