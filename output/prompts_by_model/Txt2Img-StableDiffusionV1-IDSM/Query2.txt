Model: Customize StyleGAN with One Hand Sketch
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18949v1.pdf
Summary: Generating images from human sketches typically requires dedicated networks trained from scratch. In contrast, the emergence of the pre-trained Vision-Language models (e.g., CLIP) has propelled generative applications based on controlling the output imagery of existing StyleGAN models with text inputs or reference images. Parallelly, our work proposes a framework to control StyleGAN imagery with a single user sketch. In particular, we learn a conditional distribution in the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN model via energy-based learning and propose two novel energy functions leveraging CLIP for cross-domain semantic supervision. Once trained, our model can generate multi-modal images semantically aligned with the input sketch. Quantitative evaluations on synthesized datasets have shown that our approach improves significantly from previous methods in the one-shot regime. The superiority of our method is further underscored when experimenting with a wide range of human sketches of diverse styles and poses. Surprisingly, our models outperform the previous baseline regarding both the range of sketch inputs and image qualities despite operating with a stricter setting: with no extra training data and single sketch input.

Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing

Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

Model: TIAM -- A Metric for Evaluating Alignment in Text-to-Image Generation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05134v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/grimalpaul/tiam
Summary: The progress in the generation of synthetic images has made it crucial to assess their quality. While several metrics have been proposed to assess the rendering of images, it is crucial for Text-to-Image (T2I) models, which generate images based on a prompt, to consider additional aspects such as to which extent the generated image matches the important content of the prompt. Moreover, although the generated images usually result from a random starting point, the influence of this one is generally not considered. In this article, we propose a new metric based on prompt templates to study the alignment between the content specified in the prompt and the corresponding generated images. It allows us to better characterize the alignment in terms of the type of the specified objects, their number, and their color. We conducted a study on several recent T2I models about various aspects. An additional interesting result we obtained with our approach is that image quality can vary drastically depending on the noise used as a seed for the images. We also quantify the influence of the number of concepts in the prompt, their order as well as their (color) attributes. Finally, our method allows us to identify some seeds that produce better images than others, opening novel directions of research on this understudied topic.
