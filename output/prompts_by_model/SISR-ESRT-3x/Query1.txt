A user has asked the following question:
"I upscaled a web image by 3× and the AI kept edges sharp and text readable. How does this model preserve structure so clearly without introducing blur?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Saliency Suppressed, Semantics Surfaced: Visual Transformations in Neural Networks and the Brain

Summary: Deep learning algorithms lack human-interpretable accounts of how they transform raw visual input into a robust semantic understanding, which impedes comparisons between different architectures, training objectives, and the human brain. In this work, we take inspiration from neuroscience and employ representational approaches to shed light on how neural networks encode information at low (visual saliency) and high (semantic similarity) levels of abstraction. Moreover, we introduce a custom image dataset where we systematically manipulate salient and semantic information. We find that ResNets are more sensitive to saliency information than ViTs, when trained with object classification objectives. We uncover that networks suppress saliency in early layers, a process enhanced by natural language supervision (CLIP) in ResNets. CLIP also enhances semantic encoding in both architectures. Finally, we show that semantic encoding is a key factor in aligning AI with human visual perception, while saliency suppression is a non-brain-like strategy.

Model: LLaVAR: Enhanced Visual Instruction Tuning for Text-Rich Image Understanding
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17107v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/SALT-NLP/LLaVAR
Summary: Instruction tuning unlocks the superior capability of Large Language Models (LLM) to interact with humans. Furthermore, recent instruction-following datasets include images as visual inputs, collecting responses for image-based instructions. However, visual instruction-tuned models cannot comprehend textual details within images well. This work enhances the current visual instruction tuning pipeline with text-rich images (e.g., movie posters, book covers, etc.). Specifically, we first use publicly available OCR tools to collect results on 422K text-rich images from the LAION dataset. Moreover, we prompt text-only GPT-4 with recognized texts and image captions to generate 16K conversations, each containing question-answer pairs for text-rich images. By combining our collected data with previous multi-modal instruction-following data, our model, LLaVAR, substantially improves the LLaVA model's capability on text-based VQA datasets (up to 20% accuracy improvement) while achieving an accuracy of 91.42% on ScienceQA. The GPT-4-based instruction-following evaluation also demonstrates the improvement of our model on both natural images and text-rich images. Through qualitative analysis, LLaVAR shows promising interaction (e.g., reasoning, writing, and elaboration) skills with humans based on the latest real-world online content that combines text and images. We make our code/data/models publicly available at https://llavar.github.io/.
