You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I enlarged a small UI image by 3× and was surprised how clean and crisp the lines were. How does AI reconstruct such sharp details when the original barely shows them?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: AI-generated Image Quality Assessment in Visual Communication
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15677v1.pdf

Summary: Assessing the quality of artificial intelligence-generated images (AIGIs) plays a crucial role in their application in real-world scenarios. However, traditional image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms primarily focus on low-level visual perception, while existing IQA works on AIGIs overemphasize the generated content itself, neglecting its effectiveness in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AIGI-VC, a quality assessment database for AI-Generated Images in Visual Communication, which studies the communicability of AIGIs in the advertising field from the perspectives of information clarity and emotional interaction. The dataset consists of 2,500 images spanning 14 advertisement topics and 8 emotion types. It provides coarse-grained human preference annotations and fine-grained preference descriptions, benchmarking the abilities of IQA methods in preference prediction, interpretation, and reasoning. We conduct an empirical study of existing representative IQA methods and large multi-modal models on the AIGI-VC dataset, uncovering their strengths and weaknesses.

Model: CoF: Coarse to Fine-Grained Image Understanding for Multi-modal Large Language Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16869v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/gavin001201/cof
Summary: The impressive performance of Large Language Model (LLM) has prompted researchers to develop Multi-modal LLM (MLLM), which has shown great potential for various multi-modal tasks. However, current MLLM often struggles to effectively address fine-grained multi-modal challenges. We argue that this limitation is closely linked to the models' visual grounding capabilities. The restricted spatial awareness and perceptual acuity of visual encoders frequently lead to interference from irrelevant background information in images, causing the models to overlook subtle but crucial details. As a result, achieving fine-grained regional visual comprehension becomes difficult. In this paper, we break down multi-modal understanding into two stages, from Coarse to Fine (CoF). In the first stage, we prompt the MLLM to locate the approximate area of the answer. In the second stage, we further enhance the model's focus on relevant areas within the image through visual prompt engineering, adjusting attention weights of pertinent regions. This, in turn, improves both visual grounding and overall performance in downstream tasks. Our experiments show that this approach significantly boosts the performance of baseline models, demonstrating notable generalization and effectiveness.
