Model: Occ$^2$Net: Robust Image Matching Based on 3D Occupancy Estimation for Occluded Regions
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16160v1.pdf
Summary: Image matching is a fundamental and critical task in various visual applications, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and image retrieval, which require accurate pose estimation. However, most existing methods ignore the occlusion relations between objects caused by camera motion and scene structure. In this paper, we propose Occ$^2$Net, a novel image matching method that models occlusion relations using 3D occupancy and infers matching points in occluded regions. Thanks to the inductive bias encoded in the Occupancy Estimation (OE) module, it greatly simplifies bootstrapping of a multi-view consistent 3D representation that can then integrate information from multiple views. Together with an Occlusion-Aware (OA) module, it incorporates attention layers and rotation alignment to enable matching between occluded and visible points. We evaluate our method on both real-world and simulated datasets and demonstrate its superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on several metrics, especially in occlusion scenarios.

Model: Automatic occlusion removal from 3D maps for maritime situational awareness
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03451v1.pdf
Summary: We introduce a novel method for updating 3D geospatial models, specifically targeting occlusion removal in large-scale maritime environments. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques often face problems with dynamic objects, like cars or vessels, that obscure the true environment, leading to inaccurate models or requiring extensive manual editing. Our approach leverages deep learning techniques, including instance segmentation and generative inpainting, to directly modify both the texture and geometry of 3D meshes without the need for costly reprocessing. By selectively targeting occluding objects and preserving static elements, the method enhances both geometric and visual accuracy. This approach not only preserves structural and textural details of map data but also maintains compatibility with current geospatial standards, ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements in 3D model fidelity, making this method highly applicable for maritime situational awareness and the dynamic display of auxiliary information.

Model: LoCUS: Learning Multiscale 3D-consistent Features from Posed Images
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01095v1.pdf
Summary: An important challenge for autonomous agents such as robots is to maintain a spatially and temporally consistent model of the world. It must be maintained through occlusions, previously-unseen views, and long time horizons (e.g., loop closure and re-identification). It is still an open question how to train such a versatile neural representation without supervision. We start from the idea that the training objective can be framed as a patch retrieval problem: given an image patch in one view of a scene, we would like to retrieve (with high precision and recall) all patches in other views that map to the same real-world location. One drawback is that this objective does not promote reusability of features: by being unique to a scene (achieving perfect precision/recall), a representation will not be useful in the context of other scenes. We find that it is possible to balance retrieval and reusability by constructing the retrieval set carefully, leaving out patches that map to far-away locations. Similarly, we can easily regulate the scale of the learned features (e.g., points, objects, or rooms) by adjusting the spatial tolerance for considering a retrieval to be positive. We optimize for (smooth) Average Precision (AP), in a single unified ranking-based objective. This objective also doubles as a criterion for choosing landmarks or keypoints, as patches with high AP. We show results creating sparse, multi-scale, semantic spatial maps composed of highly identifiable landmarks, with applications in landmark retrieval, localization, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.
