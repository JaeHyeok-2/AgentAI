Model: CARPE-ID: Continuously Adaptable Re-identification for Personalized Robot Assistance
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19413v2.pdf
Summary: In today's Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios, a prevailing tendency exists to assume that the robot shall cooperate with the closest individual or that the scene involves merely a singular human actor. However, in realistic scenarios, such as shop floor operations, such an assumption may not hold and personalized target recognition by the robot in crowded environments is required. To fulfil this requirement, in this work, we propose a person re-identification module based on continual visual adaptation techniques that ensure the robot's seamless cooperation with the appropriate individual even subject to varying visual appearances or partial or complete occlusions. We test the framework singularly using recorded videos in a laboratory environment and an HRI scenario, i.e., a person-following task by a mobile robot. The targets are asked to change their appearance during tracking and to disappear from the camera field of view to test the challenging cases of occlusion and outfit variations. We compare our framework with one of the state-of-the-art Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) methods and the results show that the CARPE-ID can accurately track each selected target throughout the experiments in all the cases (except two limit cases). At the same time, the s-o-t-a MOT has a mean of 4 tracking errors for each video.

Model: Target-Aware Tracking with Long-term Context Attention

Summary: Most deep trackers still follow the guidance of the siamese paradigms and use a template that contains only the target without any contextual information, which makes it difficult for the tracker to cope with large appearance changes, rapid target movement, and attraction from similar objects. To alleviate the above problem, we propose a long-term context attention (LCA) module that can perform extensive information fusion on the target and its context from long-term frames, and calculate the target correlation while enhancing target features. The complete contextual information contains the location of the target as well as the state around the target. LCA uses the target state from the previous frame to exclude the interference of similar objects and complex backgrounds, thus accurately locating the target and enabling the tracker to obtain higher robustness and regression accuracy. By embedding the LCA module in Transformer, we build a powerful online tracker with a target-aware backbone, termed as TATrack. In addition, we propose a dynamic online update algorithm based on the classification confidence of historical information without additional calculation burden. Our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, with 71.1\% AUC, 89.3\% NP, and 73.0\% AO on LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10k. The code and trained models are available on https://github.com/hekaijie123/TATrack.

Model: Object-Focused Data Selection for Dense Prediction Tasks
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10032v1.pdf
Summary: While unlabeled image data is often plentiful, the costs of high-quality labels pose an important practical challenge: Which images should one select for labeling to use the annotation budget for a particular target task most effectively? To address this problem, we focus on single-pass data selection, which refers to the process of selecting all data to be annotated at once before training a downstream model. Prior methods for single-pass data selection rely on image-level representations and fail to reliably outperform random selection for object detection and segmentation. We propose Object-Focused Data Selection (OFDS) which leverages object-level features from foundation models and ensures semantic coverage of all target classes. In extensive experiments across tasks and target domains, OFDS consistently outperforms random selection and all baselines. The best results for constrained annotation budgets are obtained by combining human labels from OFDS with autolabels from foundation models. Moreover, using OFDS to select the initial labeled set for active learning yields consistent improvements
