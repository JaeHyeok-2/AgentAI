Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06657v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/felixcheng97/agap
Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

Model: DreamColour: Controllable Video Colour Editing without Training
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05180v1.pdf
Summary: Video colour editing is a crucial task for content creation, yet existing solutions either require painstaking frame-by-frame manipulation or produce unrealistic results with temporal artefacts. We present a practical, training-free framework that makes precise video colour editing accessible through an intuitive interface while maintaining professional-quality output. Our key insight is that by decoupling spatial and temporal aspects of colour editing, we can better align with users' natural workflow -- allowing them to focus on precise colour selection in key frames before automatically propagating changes across time. We achieve this through a novel technical framework that combines: (i) a simple point-and-click interface merging grid-based colour selection with automatic instance segmentation for precise spatial control, (ii) bidirectional colour propagation that leverages inherent video motion patterns, and (iii) motion-aware blending that ensures smooth transitions even with complex object movements. Through extensive evaluation on diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods while eliminating the need for training or specialized hardware, making professional-quality video colour editing accessible to everyone.

Model: SI-FID: Only One Objective Indicator for Evaluating Stitched Images
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13905v1.pdf
Summary: Image quality evaluation accurately is vital in developing image stitching algorithms as it directly reflects the algorithms progress. However, commonly used objective indicators always produce inconsistent and even conflicting results with subjective indicators. To enhance the consistency between objective and subjective evaluations, this paper introduces a novel indicator the Frechet Distance for Stitched Images (SI-FID). To be specific, our training network employs the contrastive learning architecture overall. We employ data augmentation approaches that serve as noise to distort images in the training set. Both the initial and distorted training sets are then input into the pre-training model for fine-tuning. We then evaluate the altered FID after introducing interference to the test set and examine if the noise can improve the consistency between objective and subjective evaluation results. The rank correlation coefficient is utilized to measure the consistency. SI-FID is an altered FID that generates the highest rank correlation coefficient under the effect of a certain noise. The experimental results demonstrate that the rank correlation coefficient obtained by SI-FID is at least 25% higher than other objective indicators, which means achieving evaluation results closer to human subjective evaluation.
