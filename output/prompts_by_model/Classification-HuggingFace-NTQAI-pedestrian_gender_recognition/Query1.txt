You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"While scrolling through old street photos, my phone labeled people as ‘male’ or ‘female’—even from behind or at a distance. How does AI recognize gender from photos like that? What kind of training data do these models use, and how do they handle edge cases or ambiguity?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Human and AI Perceptual Differences in Image Classification Errors
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08733v2.pdf
Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) models for computer vision trained with supervised machine learning are assumed to solve classification tasks by imitating human behavior learned from training labels. Most efforts in recent vision research focus on measuring the model task performance using standardized benchmarks such as accuracy. However, limited work has sought to understand the perceptual difference between humans and machines. To fill this gap, this study first analyzes the statistical distributions of mistakes from the two sources and then explores how task difficulty level affects these distributions. We find that even when AI learns an excellent model from the training data, one that outperforms humans in overall accuracy, these AI models have significant and consistent differences from human perception. We demonstrate the importance of studying these differences with a simple human-AI teaming algorithm that outperforms humans alone, AI alone, or AI-AI teaming.

Model: GRADIEND: Monosemantic Feature Learning within Neural Networks Applied to Gender Debiasing of Transformer Models

Summary: AI systems frequently exhibit and amplify social biases, including gender bias, leading to harmful consequences in critical areas. This study introduces a novel encoder-decoder approach that leverages model gradients to learn a single monosemantic feature neuron encoding gender information. We show that our method can be used to debias transformer-based language models, while maintaining other capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various model architectures and highlight its potential for broader applications.

Model: Addressing Weak Decision Boundaries in Image Classification by Leveraging Web Search and Generative Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19986v1.pdf
Summary: Machine learning (ML) technologies are known to be riddled with ethical and operational problems, however, we are witnessing an increasing thrust by businesses to deploy them in sensitive applications. One major issue among many is that ML models do not perform equally well for underrepresented groups. This puts vulnerable populations in an even disadvantaged and unfavorable position. We propose an approach that leverages the power of web search and generative models to alleviate some of the shortcomings of discriminative models. We demonstrate our method on an image classification problem using ImageNet's People Subtree subset, and show that it is effective in enhancing robustness and mitigating bias in certain classes that represent vulnerable populations (e.g., female doctor of color). Our new method is able to (1) identify weak decision boundaries for such classes; (2) construct search queries for Google as well as text for generating images through DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion; and (3) show how these newly captured training samples could alleviate population bias issue. While still improving the model's overall performance considerably, we achieve a significant reduction (77.30\%) in the model's gender accuracy disparity. In addition to these improvements, we observed a notable enhancement in the classifier's decision boundary, as it is characterized by fewer weakspots and an increased separation between classes. Although we showcase our method on vulnerable populations in this study, the proposed technique is extendable to a wide range of problems and domains.
