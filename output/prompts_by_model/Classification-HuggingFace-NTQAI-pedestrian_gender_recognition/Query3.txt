A user has asked the following question:
"While setting up a retail analytics system, we want to automatically analyze customer demographics from CCTV footage. How do AI models today achieve accurate gender recognition, and what steps are usually taken during training to ensure fairness and avoid biases related to ethnicity, clothing, or camera angles?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.

Model: Multimodal Approaches to Fair Image Classification: An Ethical Perspective
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12165v1.pdf
Summary: In the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence, machine perception is becoming paramount to achieving increased performance. Image classification systems are becoming increasingly integral to various applications, ranging from medical diagnostics to image generation; however, these systems often exhibit harmful biases that can lead to unfair and discriminatory outcomes. Machine Learning systems that depend on a single data modality, i.e. only images or only text, can exaggerate hidden biases present in the training data, if the data is not carefully balanced and filtered. Even so, these models can still harm underrepresented populations when used in improper contexts, such as when government agencies reinforce racial bias using predictive policing. This thesis explores the intersection of technology and ethics in the development of fair image classification models. Specifically, I focus on improving fairness and methods of using multiple modalities to combat harmful demographic bias. Integrating multimodal approaches, which combine visual data with additional modalities such as text and metadata, allows this work to enhance the fairness and accuracy of image classification systems. The study critically examines existing biases in image datasets and classification algorithms, proposes innovative methods for mitigating these biases, and evaluates the ethical implications of deploying such systems in real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experimentation and analysis, the thesis demonstrates how multimodal techniques can contribute to more equitable and ethical AI solutions, ultimately advocating for responsible AI practices that prioritize fairness.

Model: Evaluating Fairness in Large Vision-Language Models Across Diverse Demographic Attributes and Prompts
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17974v2.pdf

Summary: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved significant progress, demonstrating strong capabilities in open-world visual understanding. However, it is not yet clear how LVLMs address demographic biases in real life, especially the disparities across attributes such as gender, skin tone, age and race. In this paper, We empirically investigate visual fairness in several mainstream LVLMs by auditing their performance disparities across demographic attributes using public fairness benchmark datasets (e.g., FACET, UTKFace). Our fairness evaluation framework employs direct and single-choice question prompt on visual question-answering/classification tasks. Despite advancements in visual understanding, our zero-shot prompting results show that both open-source and closed-source LVLMs continue to exhibit fairness issues across different prompts and demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a potential multi-modal Chain-of-thought (CoT) based strategy for bias mitigation, applicable to both open-source and closed-source LVLMs. This approach enhances transparency and offers a scalable solution for addressing fairness, providing a solid foundation for future bias reduction efforts.

Model: The 8th AI City Challenge
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09432v1.pdf
Summary: The eighth AI City Challenge highlighted the convergence of computer vision and artificial intelligence in areas like retail, warehouse settings, and Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS), presenting significant research opportunities. The 2024 edition featured five tracks, attracting unprecedented interest from 726 teams in 47 countries and regions. Track 1 dealt with multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) people tracking, highlighting significant enhancements in camera count, character number, 3D annotation, and camera matrices, alongside new rules for 3D tracking and online tracking algorithm encouragement. Track 2 introduced dense video captioning for traffic safety, focusing on pedestrian accidents using multi-camera feeds to improve insights for insurance and prevention. Track 3 required teams to classify driver actions in a naturalistic driving analysis. Track 4 explored fish-eye camera analytics using the FishEye8K dataset. Track 5 focused on motorcycle helmet rule violation detection. The challenge utilized two leaderboards to showcase methods, with participants setting new benchmarks, some surpassing existing state-of-the-art achievements.
