You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"Even abstract things like “sunset,” “celebration,” or “mood” were picked up in the tags. What kind of model understands not just objects, but also context and feeling?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Tags for Large Vision-Language Understanding in Complex Scenes
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11396v1.pdf
Summary: Object-aware reasoning in vision-language tasks poses significant challenges for current models, particularly in handling unseen objects, reducing hallucinations, and capturing fine-grained relationships in complex visual scenes. To address these limitations, we propose the Vision-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Prompting (VRAP) framework, a generative approach that enhances Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by integrating retrieval-augmented object tags into their prompts. VRAP introduces a novel pipeline where structured tags, including objects, attributes, and relationships, are extracted using pretrained visual encoders and scene graph parsers. These tags are enriched with external knowledge and incorporated into the LLM's input, enabling detailed and accurate reasoning. We evaluate VRAP across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including VQAv2, GQA, VizWiz, and COCO, achieving state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained reasoning and multimodal understanding. Additionally, our ablation studies highlight the importance of retrieval-augmented tags and contrastive learning, while human evaluations confirm VRAP's ability to generate accurate, detailed, and contextually relevant responses. Notably, VRAP achieves a 40% reduction in inference latency by eliminating runtime retrieval. These results demonstrate that VRAP is a robust and efficient framework for advancing object-aware multimodal reasoning.

Model: The All-Seeing Project V2: Towards General Relation Comprehension of the Open World
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19474v4.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/opengvlab/all-seeing
Summary: We present the All-Seeing Project V2: a new model and dataset designed for understanding object relations in images. Specifically, we propose the All-Seeing Model V2 (ASMv2) that integrates the formulation of text generation, object localization, and relation comprehension into a relation conversation (ReC) task. Leveraging this unified task, our model excels not only in perceiving and recognizing all objects within the image but also in grasping the intricate relation graph between them, diminishing the relation hallucination often encountered by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To facilitate training and evaluation of MLLMs in relation understanding, we created the first high-quality ReC dataset ({AS-V2) which is aligned with the format of standard instruction tuning data. In addition, we design a new benchmark, termed Circular-based Relation Probing Evaluation (CRPE) for comprehensively evaluating the relation comprehension capabilities of MLLMs. Notably, our ASMv2 achieves an overall accuracy of 52.04 on this relation-aware benchmark, surpassing the 43.14 of LLaVA-1.5 by a large margin. We hope that our work can inspire more future research and contribute to the evolution towards artificial general intelligence. Our project is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/all-seeing.
