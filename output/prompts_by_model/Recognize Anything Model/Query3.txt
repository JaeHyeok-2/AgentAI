Model: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Tags for Large Vision-Language Understanding in Complex Scenes
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11396v1.pdf
Summary: Object-aware reasoning in vision-language tasks poses significant challenges for current models, particularly in handling unseen objects, reducing hallucinations, and capturing fine-grained relationships in complex visual scenes. To address these limitations, we propose the Vision-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Prompting (VRAP) framework, a generative approach that enhances Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by integrating retrieval-augmented object tags into their prompts. VRAP introduces a novel pipeline where structured tags, including objects, attributes, and relationships, are extracted using pretrained visual encoders and scene graph parsers. These tags are enriched with external knowledge and incorporated into the LLM's input, enabling detailed and accurate reasoning. We evaluate VRAP across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including VQAv2, GQA, VizWiz, and COCO, achieving state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained reasoning and multimodal understanding. Additionally, our ablation studies highlight the importance of retrieval-augmented tags and contrastive learning, while human evaluations confirm VRAP's ability to generate accurate, detailed, and contextually relevant responses. Notably, VRAP achieves a 40% reduction in inference latency by eliminating runtime retrieval. These results demonstrate that VRAP is a robust and efficient framework for advancing object-aware multimodal reasoning.

Model: PhotoBot: Reference-Guided Interactive Photography via Natural Language
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11061v4.pdf
Summary: We introduce PhotoBot, a framework for fully automated photo acquisition based on an interplay between high-level human language guidance and a robot photographer. We propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via reference images that are selected from a curated gallery. We leverage a visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize the reference images via textual descriptions and then use a large language model (LLM) to retrieve relevant reference images based on a user's language query through text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference image and the observed scene, we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing semantic similarity across marked appearance variations. Using these features, we compute suggested pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach using a manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by users themselves, as measured by human feedback. We also show that PhotoBot can generalize to other reference sources such as paintings.

Model: Catalog Phrase Grounding (CPG): Grounding of Product Textual Attributes in Product Images for e-commerce Vision-Language Applications
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16354v1.pdf
Summary: We present Catalog Phrase Grounding (CPG), a model that can associate product textual data (title, brands) into corresponding regions of product images (isolated product region, brand logo region) for e-commerce vision-language applications. We use a state-of-the-art modulated multimodal transformer encoder-decoder architecture unifying object detection and phrase-grounding. We train the model in self-supervised fashion with 2.3 million image-text pairs synthesized from an e-commerce site. The self-supervision data is annotated with high-confidence pseudo-labels generated with a combination of teacher models: a pre-trained general domain phrase grounding model (e.g. MDETR) and a specialized logo detection model. This allows CPG, as a student model, to benefit from transfer knowledge from these base models combining general-domain knowledge and specialized knowledge. Beyond immediate catalog phrase grounding tasks, we can benefit from CPG representations by incorporating them as ML features into downstream catalog applications that require deep semantic understanding of products. Our experiments on product-brand matching, a challenging e-commerce application, show that incorporating CPG representations into the existing production ensemble system leads to on average 5% recall improvement across all countries globally (with the largest lift of 11% in a single country) at fixed 95% precision, outperforming other alternatives including a logo detection teacher model and ResNet50.
