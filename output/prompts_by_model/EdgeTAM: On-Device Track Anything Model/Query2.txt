Model: PointOdyssey: A Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset for Long-Term Point Tracking
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15055v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/y-zheng18/point_odyssey
Summary: We introduce PointOdyssey, a large-scale synthetic dataset, and data generation framework, for the training and evaluation of long-term fine-grained tracking algorithms. Our goal is to advance the state-of-the-art by placing emphasis on long videos with naturalistic motion. Toward the goal of naturalism, we animate deformable characters using real-world motion capture data, we build 3D scenes to match the motion capture environments, and we render camera viewpoints using trajectories mined via structure-from-motion on real videos. We create combinatorial diversity by randomizing character appearance, motion profiles, materials, lighting, 3D assets, and atmospheric effects. Our dataset currently includes 104 videos, averaging 2,000 frames long, with orders of magnitude more correspondence annotations than prior work. We show that existing methods can be trained from scratch in our dataset and outperform the published variants. Finally, we introduce modifications to the PIPs point tracking method, greatly widening its temporal receptive field, which improves its performance on PointOdyssey as well as on two real-world benchmarks.

Model: SLoMo: A General System for Legged Robot Motion Imitation from Casual Videos
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14389v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/johnzhang3/slomo
Summary: We present SLoMo: a first-of-its-kind framework for transferring skilled motions from casually captured "in the wild" video footage of humans and animals to legged robots. SLoMo works in three stages: 1) synthesize a physically plausible reconstructed key-point trajectory from monocular videos; 2) optimize a dynamically feasible reference trajectory for the robot offline that includes body and foot motion, as well as contact sequences that closely tracks the key points; 3) track the reference trajectory online using a general-purpose model-predictive controller on robot hardware. Traditional motion imitation for legged motor skills often requires expert animators, collaborative demonstrations, and/or expensive motion capture equipment, all of which limits scalability. Instead, SLoMo only relies on easy-to-obtain monocular video footage, readily available in online repositories such as YouTube. It converts videos into motion primitives that can be executed reliably by real-world robots. We demonstrate our approach by transferring the motions of cats, dogs, and humans to example robots including a quadruped (on hardware) and a humanoid (in simulation). To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first attempt at a general-purpose motion transfer framework that imitates animal and human motions on legged robots directly from casual videos without artificial markers or labels.

Model: Fast Trajectory End-Point Prediction with Event Cameras for Reactive Robot Control
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13796v1.pdf
Summary: Prediction skills can be crucial for the success of tasks where robots have limited time to act or joints actuation power. In such a scenario, a vision system with a fixed, possibly too low, sampling rate could lead to the loss of informative points, slowing down prediction convergence and reducing the accuracy. In this paper, we propose to exploit the low latency, motion-driven sampling, and data compression properties of event cameras to overcome these issues. As a use-case, we use a Panda robotic arm to intercept a ball bouncing on a table. To predict the interception point, we adopt a Stateful LSTM network, a specific LSTM variant without fixed input length, which perfectly suits the event-driven paradigm and the problem at hand, where the length of the trajectory is not defined. We train the network in simulation to speed up the dataset acquisition and then fine-tune the models on real trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate how using a dense spatial sampling (i.e. event cameras) significantly increases the number of intercepted trajectories as compared to a fixed temporal sampling (i.e. frame-based cameras).
