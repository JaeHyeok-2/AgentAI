You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I clicked on an image and it instantly labeled not just the object, but also its parts—like wheels, handles, and buttons. How does it recognize things at that level of detail?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: A Self-Supervised Method for Body Part Segmentation and Keypoint Detection of Rat Images
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04650v1.pdf
Summary: Recognition of individual components and keypoint detection supported by instance segmentation is crucial to analyze the behavior of agents on the scene. Such systems could be used for surveillance, self-driving cars, and also for medical research, where behavior analysis of laboratory animals is used to confirm the aftereffects of a given medicine. A method capable of solving the aforementioned tasks usually requires a large amount of high-quality hand-annotated data, which takes time and money to produce. In this paper, we propose a method that alleviates the need for manual labeling of laboratory rats. To do so, first, we generate initial annotations with a computer vision-based approach, then through extensive augmentation, we train a deep neural network on the generated data. The final system is capable of instance segmentation, keypoint detection, and body part segmentation even when the objects are heavily occluded.

Model: Open-domain Visual Entity Recognition: Towards Recognizing Millions of Wikipedia Entities
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11154v2.pdf

Summary: Large-scale multi-modal pre-training models such as CLIP and PaLI exhibit strong generalization on various visual domains and tasks. However, existing image classification benchmarks often evaluate recognition on a specific domain (e.g., outdoor images) or a specific task (e.g., classifying plant species), which falls short of evaluating whether pre-trained foundational models are universal visual recognizers. To address this, we formally present the task of Open-domain Visual Entity recognitioN (OVEN), where a model need to link an image onto a Wikipedia entity with respect to a text query. We construct OVEN-Wiki by re-purposing 14 existing datasets with all labels grounded onto one single label space: Wikipedia entities. OVEN challenges models to select among six million possible Wikipedia entities, making it a general visual recognition benchmark with the largest number of labels. Our study on state-of-the-art pre-trained models reveals large headroom in generalizing to the massive-scale label space. We show that a PaLI-based auto-regressive visual recognition model performs surprisingly well, even on Wikipedia entities that have never been seen during fine-tuning. We also find existing pretrained models yield different strengths: while PaLI-based models obtain higher overall performance, CLIP-based models are better at recognizing tail entities.

Model: NeuralLabeling: A versatile toolset for labeling vision datasets using Neural Radiance Fields
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11966v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/FlorisE/neural-labeling
Summary: We present NeuralLabeling, a labeling approach and toolset for annotating 3D scenes using either bounding boxes or meshes and generating segmentation masks, affordance maps, 2D bounding boxes, 3D bounding boxes, 6DOF object poses, depth maps, and object meshes. NeuralLabeling uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as a renderer, allowing labeling to be performed using 3D spatial tools while incorporating geometric clues such as occlusions, relying only on images captured from multiple viewpoints as input. To demonstrate the applicability of NeuralLabeling to a practical problem in robotics, we added ground truth depth maps to 30000 frames of transparent object RGB and noisy depth maps of glasses placed in a dishwasher captured using an RGBD sensor, yielding the Dishwasher30k dataset. We show that training a simple deep neural network with supervision using the annotated depth maps yields a higher reconstruction performance than training with the previously applied weakly supervised approach. We also show how instance segmentation and depth completion datasets generated using NeuralLabeling can be incorporated into a robot application for grasping transparent objects placed in a dishwasher with an accuracy of 83.3%, compared to 16.3% without depth completion.
