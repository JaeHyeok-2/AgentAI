Model: RSUD20K: A Dataset for Road Scene Understanding In Autonomous Driving
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07322v2.pdf

Summary: Road scene understanding is crucial in autonomous driving, enabling machines to perceive the visual environment. However, recent object detectors tailored for learning on datasets collected from certain geographical locations struggle to generalize across different locations. In this paper, we present RSUD20K, a new dataset for road scene understanding, comprised of over 20K high-resolution images from the driving perspective on Bangladesh roads, and includes 130K bounding box annotations for 13 objects. This challenging dataset encompasses diverse road scenes, narrow streets and highways, featuring objects from different viewpoints and scenes from crowded environments with densely cluttered objects and various weather conditions. Our work significantly improves upon previous efforts, providing detailed annotations and increased object complexity. We thoroughly examine the dataset, benchmarking various state-of-the-art object detectors and exploring large vision models as image annotators.

Model: Self-improving object detection via disagreement reconciliation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10624v1.pdf
Summary: Object detectors often experience a drop in performance when new environmental conditions are insufficiently represented in the training data. This paper studies how to automatically fine-tune a pre-existing object detector while exploring and acquiring images in a new environment without relying on human intervention, i.e., in a self-supervised fashion. In our setting, an agent initially explores the environment using a pre-trained off-the-shelf detector to locate objects and associate pseudo-labels. By assuming that pseudo-labels for the same object must be consistent across different views, we devise a novel mechanism for producing refined predictions from the consensus among observations. Our approach improves the off-the-shelf object detector by 2.66% in terms of mAP and outperforms the current state of the art without relying on ground-truth annotations.

Model: Uncertainty Calibration and its Application to Object Detection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02622v1.pdf
Summary: Image-based environment perception is an important component especially for driver assistance systems or autonomous driving. In this scope, modern neuronal networks are used to identify multiple objects as well as the according position and size information within a single frame. The performance of such an object detection model is important for the overall performance of the whole system. However, a detection model might also predict these objects under a certain degree of uncertainty. [...]   In this work, we examine the semantic uncertainty (which object type?) as well as the spatial uncertainty (where is the object and how large is it?). We evaluate if the predicted uncertainties of an object detection model match with the observed error that is achieved on real-world data. In the first part of this work, we introduce the definition for confidence calibration of the semantic uncertainty in the context of object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. We integrate additional position information in our examinations to evaluate the effect of the object's position on the semantic calibration properties. Besides measuring calibration, it is also possible to perform a post-hoc recalibration of semantic uncertainty that might have turned out to be miscalibrated. [...]   The second part of this work deals with the spatial uncertainty obtained by a probabilistic detection model. [...] We review and extend common calibration methods so that it is possible to obtain parametric uncertainty distributions for the position information in a more flexible way.   In the last part, we demonstrate a possible use-case for our derived calibration methods in the context of object tracking. [...] We integrate our previously proposed calibration techniques and demonstrate the usefulness of semantic and spatial uncertainty calibration in a subsequent process. [...]
