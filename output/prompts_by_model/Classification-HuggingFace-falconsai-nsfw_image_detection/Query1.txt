You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"Some of my photos were flagged as inappropriate even without tags. How does AI know what’s NSFW just from the image alone?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16338v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/fcakyon/content-moderation-deep-learning
Summary: This paper presents a comparative analysis of existing nudity classification techniques for classifying images based on the presence of nudity, with a focus on their application in content moderation. The evaluation focuses on CNN-based models, vision transformer, and popular open-source safety checkers from Stable Diffusion and Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network (LAION). The study identifies the limitations of current evaluation datasets and highlights the need for more diverse and challenging datasets. The paper discusses the potential implications of these findings for developing more accurate and effective image classification systems on online platforms. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of continually improving image classification models to ensure the safety and well-being of platform users.

Model: Quality Assured: Rethinking Annotation Strategies in Imaging AI
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17596v2.pdf
Summary: This paper does not describe a novel method. Instead, it studies an essential foundation for reliable benchmarking and ultimately real-world application of AI-based image analysis: generating high-quality reference annotations. Previous research has focused on crowdsourcing as a means of outsourcing annotations. However, little attention has so far been given to annotation companies, specifically regarding their internal quality assurance (QA) processes. Therefore, our aim is to evaluate the influence of QA employed by annotation companies on annotation quality and devise methodologies for maximizing data annotation efficacy. Based on a total of 57,648 instance segmented images obtained from a total of 924 annotators and 34 QA workers from four annotation companies and Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we derived the following insights: (1) Annotation companies perform better both in terms of quantity and quality compared to the widely used platform MTurk. (2) Annotation companies' internal QA only provides marginal improvements, if any. However, improving labeling instructions instead of investing in QA can substantially boost annotation performance. (3) The benefit of internal QA depends on specific image characteristics. Our work could enable researchers to derive substantially more value from a fixed annotation budget and change the way annotation companies conduct internal QA.
