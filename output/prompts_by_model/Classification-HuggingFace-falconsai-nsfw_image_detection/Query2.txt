You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I uploaded a photo with no obvious nudity, but it still got blurred. Can AI really judge the context of an image, not just what’s visible?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: This paper presents a comparative analysis of existing nudity classification techniques for classifying images based on the presence of nudity, with a focus on their application in content moderation. The evaluation focuses on CNN-based models, vision transformer, and popular open-source safety checkers from Stable Diffusion and Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network (LAION). The study identifies the limitations of current evaluation datasets and highlights the need for more diverse and challenging datasets. The paper discusses the potential implications of these findings for developing more accurate and effective image classification systems on online platforms. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of continually improving image classification models to ensure the safety and well-being of platform users.

Model: AI-generated Image Quality Assessment in Visual Communication
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15677v1.pdf

Summary: Assessing the quality of artificial intelligence-generated images (AIGIs) plays a crucial role in their application in real-world scenarios. However, traditional image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms primarily focus on low-level visual perception, while existing IQA works on AIGIs overemphasize the generated content itself, neglecting its effectiveness in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AIGI-VC, a quality assessment database for AI-Generated Images in Visual Communication, which studies the communicability of AIGIs in the advertising field from the perspectives of information clarity and emotional interaction. The dataset consists of 2,500 images spanning 14 advertisement topics and 8 emotion types. It provides coarse-grained human preference annotations and fine-grained preference descriptions, benchmarking the abilities of IQA methods in preference prediction, interpretation, and reasoning. We conduct an empirical study of existing representative IQA methods and large multi-modal models on the AIGI-VC dataset, uncovering their strengths and weaknesses.

Model: Two Deep Learning Solutions for Automatic Blurring of Faces in Videos
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14828v1.pdf
Summary: The widespread use of cameras in everyday life situations generates a vast amount of data that may contain sensitive information about the people and vehicles moving in front of them (location, license plates, physical characteristics, etc). In particular, people's faces are recorded by surveillance cameras in public spaces. In order to ensure the privacy of individuals, face blurring techniques can be applied to the collected videos. In this paper we present two deep-learning based options to tackle the problem. First, a direct approach, consisting of a classical object detector (based on the YOLO architecture) trained to detect faces, which are subsequently blurred. Second, an indirect approach, in which a Unet-like segmentation network is trained to output a version of the input image in which all the faces have been blurred.
