Model: HiTSR: A Hierarchical Transformer for Reference-based Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16959v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/bia006/hitsr
Summary: In this paper, we propose HiTSR, a hierarchical transformer model for reference-based image super-resolution, which enhances low-resolution input images by learning matching correspondences from high-resolution reference images. Diverging from existing multi-network, multi-stage approaches, we streamline the architecture and training pipeline by incorporating the double attention block from GAN literature. Processing two visual streams independently, we fuse self-attention and cross-attention blocks through a gating attention strategy. The model integrates a squeeze-and-excitation module to capture global context from the input images, facilitating long-range spatial interactions within window-based attention blocks. Long skip connections between shallow and deep layers further enhance information flow. Our model demonstrates superior performance across three datasets including SUN80, Urban100, and Manga109. Specifically, on the SUN80 dataset, our model achieves PSNR/SSIM values of 30.24/0.821. These results underscore the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in reference-based image super-resolution. The transformer-based model attains state-of-the-art results without the need for purpose-built subnetworks, knowledge distillation, or multi-stage training, emphasizing the potency of attention in meeting reference-based image super-resolution requirements.

Model: CausalSR: Structural Causal Model-Driven Super-Resolution with Counterfactual Inference
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15852v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/Mnster00/CasualSR
Summary: Physical and optical factors interacting with sensor characteristics create complex image degradation patterns. Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.
