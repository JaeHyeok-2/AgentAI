Summary: Diffusion models can generate realistic and diverse images, potentially facilitating data availability for data-intensive perception tasks. However, leveraging these models to boost performance on downstream tasks with synthetic data poses several challenges, including aligning with real data distribution, scaling synthetic sample volumes, and ensuring their quality. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{A}uto \textbf{C}herry-\textbf{P}icker (ACP), a novel framework that generates high-quality cross-modality training samples at scale to augment perception and multi-modal training. ACP first uses LLMs to sample descriptions and layouts based on object combinations from real data priors, eliminating the need for ground truth image captions or annotations. Next, we use an off-the-shelf controllable diffusion model to generate multiple images. Then, the generated data are refined using a comprehensively designed metric, Composite Layout and Image Score (CLIS), to ensure quality. Our customized synthetic high-quality samples boost performance in various scenarios, especially in addressing challenges associated with long-tailed distribution and imbalanced datasets. Experiment results on downstream tasks demonstrate that ACP can significantly improve the performance of existing models. In addition, we find a positive correlation between CLIS and performance gains in downstream tasks. This finding shows the potential for evaluation metrics as the role for various visual perception and MLLM tasks.

Model: A Learnable Color Correction Matrix for RAW Reconstruction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02497v1.pdf
Summary: Autonomous driving algorithms usually employ sRGB images as model input due to their compatibility with the human visual system. However, visually pleasing sRGB images are possibly sub-optimal for downstream tasks when compared to RAW images. The availability of RAW images is constrained by the difficulties in collecting real-world driving data and the associated challenges of annotation. To address this limitation and support research in RAW-domain driving perception, we design a novel and ultra-lightweight RAW reconstruction method. The proposed model introduces a learnable color correction matrix (CCM), which uses only a single convolutional layer to approximate the complex inverse image signal processor (ISP). Experimental results demonstrate that simulated RAW (simRAW) images generated by our method provide performance improvements equivalent to those produced by more complex inverse ISP methods when pretraining RAW-domain object detectors, which highlights the effectiveness and practicality of our approach.

Model: Removing Reflections from RAW Photos
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14414v2.pdf
Summary: We describe a system to remove real-world reflections from images for consumer photography. Our system operates on linear (RAW) photos, and accepts an optional contextual photo looking in the opposite direction (e.g., the "selfie" camera on a mobile device). This optional photo disambiguates what should be considered the reflection. The system is trained solely on synthetic mixtures of real RAW photos, which we combine using a reflection simulation that is photometrically and geometrically accurate. Our system comprises a base model that accepts the captured photo and optional context photo as input, and runs at 256p, followed by an up-sampling model that transforms 256p images to full resolution. The system produces preview images at 1K in 4.5-6.5s on a MacBook or iPhone 14 Pro. We show SOTA results on RAW photos that were captured in the field to embody typical consumer photos, and show that training on RAW simulation data improves performance more than the architectural variations among prior works.
