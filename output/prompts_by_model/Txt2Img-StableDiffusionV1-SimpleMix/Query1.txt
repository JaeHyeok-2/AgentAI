You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I mixed “photographic style” and “digital illustration” in one prompt and got an image that blended both perfectly. How does AI balance multiple styles at once—what’s happening with the weights under the hood?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Visual Style Prompting with Swapping Self-Attention

Summary: In the evolving domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools in content creation. Despite their remarkable capability, existing models still face challenges in achieving controlled generation with a consistent style, requiring costly fine-tuning or often inadequately transferring the visual elements due to content leakage. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, \ours, to produce a diverse range of images while maintaining specific style elements and nuances. During the denoising process, we keep the query from original features while swapping the key and value with those from reference features in the late self-attention layers. This approach allows for the visual style prompting without any fine-tuning, ensuring that generated images maintain a faithful style. Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, best reflecting the style of the references and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts most accurately.

Model: FedStyle: Style-Based Federated Learning Crowdsourcing Framework for Art Commissions
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16336v1.pdf
Summary: The unique artistic style is crucial to artists' occupational competitiveness, yet prevailing Art Commission Platforms rarely support style-based retrieval. Meanwhile, the fast-growing generative AI techniques aggravate artists' concerns about releasing personal artworks to public platforms. To achieve artistic style-based retrieval without exposing personal artworks, we propose FedStyle, a style-based federated learning crowdsourcing framework. It allows artists to train local style models and share model parameters rather than artworks for collaboration. However, most artists possess a unique artistic style, resulting in severe model drift among them. FedStyle addresses such extreme data heterogeneity by having artists learn their abstract style representations and align with the server, rather than merely aggregating model parameters lacking semantics. Besides, we introduce contrastive learning to meticulously construct the style representation space, pulling artworks with similar styles closer and keeping different ones apart in the embedding space. Extensive experiments on the proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedStyle.

Model: WSAM: Visual Explanations from Style Augmentation as Adversarial Attacker and Their Influence in Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14995v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/fmorenovr/WSAM_Style
Summary: Currently, style augmentation is capturing attention due to convolutional neural networks (CNN) being strongly biased toward recognizing textures rather than shapes. Most existing styling methods either perform a low-fidelity style transfer or a weak style representation in the embedding vector. This paper outlines a style augmentation algorithm using stochastic-based sampling with noise addition to improving randomization on a general linear transformation for style transfer. With our augmentation strategy, all models not only present incredible robustness against image stylizing but also outperform all previous methods and surpass the state-of-the-art performance for the STL-10 dataset. In addition, we present an analysis of the model interpretations under different style variations. At the same time, we compare comprehensive experiments demonstrating the performance when applied to deep neural architectures in training settings.
