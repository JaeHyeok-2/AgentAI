Model: Spatially-Adaptive Feature Modulation for Efficient Image Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13800v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/sunny2109/safmn
Summary: Although numerous solutions have been proposed for image super-resolution, they are usually incompatible with low-power devices with many computational and memory constraints. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a simple yet effective deep network to solve image super-resolution efficiently. In detail, we develop a spatially-adaptive feature modulation (SAFM) mechanism upon a vision transformer (ViT)-like block. Within it, we first apply the SAFM block over input features to dynamically select representative feature representations. As the SAFM block processes the input features from a long-range perspective, we further introduce a convolutional channel mixer (CCM) to simultaneously extract local contextual information and perform channel mixing. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is $3\times$ smaller than state-of-the-art efficient SR methods, e.g., IMDN, in terms of the network parameters and requires less computational cost while achieving comparable performance.

Model: HiTSR: A Hierarchical Transformer for Reference-based Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16959v1.pdf

Summary: In this paper, we propose HiTSR, a hierarchical transformer model for reference-based image super-resolution, which enhances low-resolution input images by learning matching correspondences from high-resolution reference images. Diverging from existing multi-network, multi-stage approaches, we streamline the architecture and training pipeline by incorporating the double attention block from GAN literature. Processing two visual streams independently, we fuse self-attention and cross-attention blocks through a gating attention strategy. The model integrates a squeeze-and-excitation module to capture global context from the input images, facilitating long-range spatial interactions within window-based attention blocks. Long skip connections between shallow and deep layers further enhance information flow. Our model demonstrates superior performance across three datasets including SUN80, Urban100, and Manga109. Specifically, on the SUN80 dataset, our model achieves PSNR/SSIM values of 30.24/0.821. These results underscore the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in reference-based image super-resolution. The transformer-based model attains state-of-the-art results without the need for purpose-built subnetworks, knowledge distillation, or multi-stage training, emphasizing the potency of attention in meeting reference-based image super-resolution requirements.

Model: FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16025v1.pdf
Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.
