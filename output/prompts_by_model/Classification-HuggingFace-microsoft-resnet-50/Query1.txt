Model: PhotoBot: Reference-Guided Interactive Photography via Natural Language
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11061v4.pdf
Summary: We introduce PhotoBot, a framework for fully automated photo acquisition based on an interplay between high-level human language guidance and a robot photographer. We propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via reference images that are selected from a curated gallery. We leverage a visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize the reference images via textual descriptions and then use a large language model (LLM) to retrieve relevant reference images based on a user's language query through text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference image and the observed scene, we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing semantic similarity across marked appearance variations. Using these features, we compute suggested pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach using a manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by users themselves, as measured by human feedback. We also show that PhotoBot can generalize to other reference sources such as paintings.

Model: EVOLVE: Emotion and Visual Output Learning via LLM Evaluation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20632v1.pdf
Summary: Human acceptance of social robots is greatly effected by empathy and perceived understanding. This necessitates accurate and flexible responses to various input data from the user. While systems such as this can become increasingly complex as more states or response types are included, new research in the application of large language models towards human-robot interaction has allowed for more streamlined perception and reaction pipelines. LLM-selected actions and emotional expressions can help reinforce the realism of displayed empathy and allow for improved communication between the robot and user. Beyond portraying empathy in spoken or written responses, this shows the possibilities of using LLMs in actuated, real world scenarios. In this work we extend research in LLM-driven nonverbal behavior for social robots by considering more open-ended emotional response selection leveraging new advances in vision-language models, along with emotionally aligned motion and color pattern selections that strengthen conveyance of meaning and empathy.

Model: AI-generated Image Quality Assessment in Visual Communication
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15677v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/ytian73/aigi-vc
Summary: Assessing the quality of artificial intelligence-generated images (AIGIs) plays a crucial role in their application in real-world scenarios. However, traditional image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms primarily focus on low-level visual perception, while existing IQA works on AIGIs overemphasize the generated content itself, neglecting its effectiveness in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AIGI-VC, a quality assessment database for AI-Generated Images in Visual Communication, which studies the communicability of AIGIs in the advertising field from the perspectives of information clarity and emotional interaction. The dataset consists of 2,500 images spanning 14 advertisement topics and 8 emotion types. It provides coarse-grained human preference annotations and fine-grained preference descriptions, benchmarking the abilities of IQA methods in preference prediction, interpretation, and reasoning. We conduct an empirical study of existing representative IQA methods and large multi-modal models on the AIGI-VC dataset, uncovering their strengths and weaknesses.
