You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"Even with old or low-quality footage, it still tracked players and actions accurately. What helps the model stay reliable across different video types?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Model: A Simple and Effective Temporal Grounding Pipeline for Basketball Broadcast Footage
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00862v1.pdf
Summary: We present a reliable temporal grounding pipeline for video-to-analytic alignment of basketball broadcast footage. Given a series of frames as input, our method quickly and accurately extracts time-remaining and quarter values from basketball broadcast scenes. Our work intends to expedite the development of large, multi-modal video datasets to train data-hungry video models in the sports action recognition domain. Our method aligns a pre-labeled corpus of play-by-play annotations containing dense event annotations to video frames, enabling quick retrieval of labeled video segments. Unlike previous methods, we forgo the need to localize game clocks by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box object detector to find semantic text regions directly. Our end-to-end approach improves the generality of our work. Additionally, interpolation and parallelization techniques prepare our pipeline for deployment in a large computing cluster. All code is made publicly available.

Model: Making Every Frame Matter: Continuous Video Understanding for Large Models via Adaptive State Modeling
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14993v1.pdf
Summary: Video activity recognition has become increasingly important in robots and embodied AI. Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.

Model: Zero-Shot Long-Form Video Understanding through Screenplay
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17309v1.pdf
Summary: The Long-form Video Question-Answering task requires the comprehension and analysis of extended video content to respond accurately to questions by utilizing both temporal and contextual information. In this paper, we present MM-Screenplayer, an advanced video understanding system with multi-modal perception capabilities that can convert any video into textual screenplay representations. Unlike previous storytelling methods, we organize video content into scenes as the basic unit, rather than just visually continuous shots. Additionally, we developed a ``Look Back'' strategy to reassess and validate uncertain information, particularly targeting breakpoint mode. MM-Screenplayer achieved highest score in the CVPR'2024 LOng-form VidEo Understanding (LOVEU) Track 1 Challenge, with a global accuracy of 87.5% and a breakpoint accuracy of 68.8%.
