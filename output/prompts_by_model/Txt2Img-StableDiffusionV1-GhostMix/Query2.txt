You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I typed “soft portrait, ghostmix style” and it came out with this dreamy glow—like pastel and film merged together. How does AI blend such subtle textures from painterly and photographic styles?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: FedStyle: Style-Based Federated Learning Crowdsourcing Framework for Art Commissions
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16336v1.pdf
Summary: The unique artistic style is crucial to artists' occupational competitiveness, yet prevailing Art Commission Platforms rarely support style-based retrieval. Meanwhile, the fast-growing generative AI techniques aggravate artists' concerns about releasing personal artworks to public platforms. To achieve artistic style-based retrieval without exposing personal artworks, we propose FedStyle, a style-based federated learning crowdsourcing framework. It allows artists to train local style models and share model parameters rather than artworks for collaboration. However, most artists possess a unique artistic style, resulting in severe model drift among them. FedStyle addresses such extreme data heterogeneity by having artists learn their abstract style representations and align with the server, rather than merely aggregating model parameters lacking semantics. Besides, we introduce contrastive learning to meticulously construct the style representation space, pulling artworks with similar styles closer and keeping different ones apart in the embedding space. Extensive experiments on the proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedStyle.

Model: DeepArt: A Benchmark to Advance Fidelity Research in AI-Generated Content
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10407v2.pdf
Summary: This paper explores the image synthesis capabilities of GPT-4, a leading multi-modal large language model. We establish a benchmark for evaluating the fidelity of texture features in images generated by GPT-4, comprising manually painted pictures and their AI-generated counterparts. The contributions of this study are threefold: First, we provide an in-depth analysis of the fidelity of image synthesis features based on GPT-4, marking the first such study on this state-of-the-art model. Second, the quantitative and qualitative experiments fully reveals the limitations of the GPT-4 model in image synthesis. Third, we have compiled a unique benchmark of manual drawings and corresponding GPT-4-generated images, introducing a new task to advance fidelity research in AI-generated content (AIGC).

Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06657v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/felixcheng97/agap
Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.
