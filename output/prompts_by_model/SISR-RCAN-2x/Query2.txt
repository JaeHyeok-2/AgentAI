Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Elastic-DETR: Making Image Resolution Learnable with Content-Specific Network Prediction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06341v1.pdf
Summary: Multi-scale image resolution is a de facto standard approach in modern object detectors, such as DETR. This technique allows for the acquisition of various scale information from multiple image resolutions. However, manual hyperparameter selection of the resolution can restrict its flexibility, which is informed by prior knowledge, necessitating human intervention. This work introduces a novel strategy for learnable resolution, called Elastic-DETR, enabling elastic utilization of multiple image resolutions. Our network provides an adaptive scale factor based on the content of the image with a compact scale prediction module (< 2 GFLOPs). The key aspect of our method lies in how to determine the resolution without prior knowledge. We present two loss functions derived from identified key components for resolution optimization: scale loss, which increases adaptiveness according to the image, and distribution loss, which determines the overall degree of scaling based on network performance. By leveraging the resolution's flexibility, we can demonstrate various models that exhibit varying trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity. We empirically show that our scheme can unleash the potential of a wide spectrum of image resolutions without constraining flexibility. Our models on MS COCO establish a maximum accuracy gain of 3.5%p or 26% decrease in computation than MS-trained DN-DETR.

Model: Reverse Knowledge Distillation: Training a Large Model using a Small One for Retinal Image Matching on Limited Data
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10698v2.pdf

Summary: Retinal image matching plays a crucial role in monitoring disease progression and treatment response. However, datasets with matched keypoints between temporally separated pairs of images are not available in abundance to train transformer-based model. We propose a novel approach based on reverse knowledge distillation to train large models with limited data while preventing overfitting. Firstly, we propose architectural modifications to a CNN-based semi-supervised method called SuperRetina that help us improve its results on a publicly available dataset. Then, we train a computationally heavier model based on a vision transformer encoder using the lighter CNN-based model, which is counter-intuitive in the field knowledge-distillation research where training lighter models based on heavier ones is the norm. Surprisingly, such reverse knowledge distillation improves generalization even further. Our experiments suggest that high-dimensional fitting in representation space may prevent overfitting unlike training directly to match the final output. We also provide a public dataset with annotations for retinal image keypoint detection and matching to help the research community develop algorithms for retinal image applications.
