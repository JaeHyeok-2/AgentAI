Model: Super-Resolution Microscopy Based on the Inherent Fluctuations of Dye Molecules
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00261v2.pdf
Summary: Fluorescence microscopy is a critical tool across various disciplines, from materials science to biomedical research, yet it is limited by the diffraction limit of resolution. Advanced super-resolution techniques such as localization microscopy and stimulated-emission-depletion microscopy often demand considerable resources. These methods depend heavily on elaborate sample-staining, complex optical systems, or prolonged acquisition periods, and their application in 3D and multicolor imaging presents significant experimental challenges. In the current work, we provide a complete demonstration of a widely accessible super-resolution imaging approach capable of 3D and multicolor imaging. We replace the confocal pinhole with an array of single-photon avalanche diodes and use the microsecond-scale fluctuations of dye molecules as a contrast mechanism. This contrast is transformed into a super-resolved image using a robust and deterministic algorithm. Our technique utilizes natural fluctuations inherent to organic dyes, thereby it does not require engineering of the blinking statistics. Our robust, versatile super-resolution method opens the way to next-generation multimodal imaging and facilitates on-demand super-resolution within a confocal architecture.

Model: HiTSR: A Hierarchical Transformer for Reference-based Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16959v1.pdf

Summary: In this paper, we propose HiTSR, a hierarchical transformer model for reference-based image super-resolution, which enhances low-resolution input images by learning matching correspondences from high-resolution reference images. Diverging from existing multi-network, multi-stage approaches, we streamline the architecture and training pipeline by incorporating the double attention block from GAN literature. Processing two visual streams independently, we fuse self-attention and cross-attention blocks through a gating attention strategy. The model integrates a squeeze-and-excitation module to capture global context from the input images, facilitating long-range spatial interactions within window-based attention blocks. Long skip connections between shallow and deep layers further enhance information flow. Our model demonstrates superior performance across three datasets including SUN80, Urban100, and Manga109. Specifically, on the SUN80 dataset, our model achieves PSNR/SSIM values of 30.24/0.821. These results underscore the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in reference-based image super-resolution. The transformer-based model attains state-of-the-art results without the need for purpose-built subnetworks, knowledge distillation, or multi-stage training, emphasizing the potency of attention in meeting reference-based image super-resolution requirements.

Model: A Study in Dataset Distillation for Image Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03656v1.pdf
Summary: Dataset distillation is the concept of condensing large datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While previous research has primarily focused on image classification, its application to image Super-Resolution (SR) remains underexplored. This exploratory work studies multiple dataset distillation techniques applied to SR, including pixel- and latent-space approaches under different aspects. Our experiments demonstrate that a 91.12% dataset size reduction can be achieved while maintaining comparable SR performance to the full dataset. We further analyze initialization strategies and distillation methods to optimize memory efficiency and computational costs. Our findings provide new insights into dataset distillation for SR and set the stage for future advancements.
