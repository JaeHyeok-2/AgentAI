Model: CausalSR: Structural Causal Model-Driven Super-Resolution with Counterfactual Inference
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15852v1.pdf

Summary: Physical and optical factors interacting with sensor characteristics create complex image degradation patterns. Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.

Model: Online Overexposed Pixels Hallucination in Videos with Adaptive Reference Frame Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15462v1.pdf
Summary: Low dynamic range (LDR) cameras cannot deal with wide dynamic range inputs, frequently leading to local overexposure issues. We present a learning-based system to reduce these artifacts without resorting to complex acquisition mechanisms like alternating exposures or costly processing that are typical of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. We propose a transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) to infer the missing HDR details. In an ablation study, we show the importance of using a multiscale DNN and train it with the proper cost function to achieve state-of-the-art quality. To aid the reconstruction of the overexposed areas, our DNN takes a reference frame from the past as an additional input. This leverages the commonly occurring temporal instabilities of autoexposure to our advantage: since well-exposed details in the current frame may be overexposed in the future, we use reinforcement learning to train a reference frame selection DNN that decides whether to adopt the current frame as a future reference. Without resorting to alternating exposures, we obtain therefore a causal, HDR hallucination algorithm with potential application in common video acquisition settings.

Model: EVQAScore: A Fine-grained Metric for Video Question Answering Data Quality Evaluation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06908v3.pdf
Summary: Video question-answering (QA) is a core task in video understanding. Evaluating the quality of video QA and video caption data quality for training video large language models (VideoLLMs) is an essential challenge. Although various methods have been proposed for assessing video caption quality, there remains a lack of dedicated evaluation methods for Video QA. To address this gap, we introduce EVQAScore, a reference-free method that leverages keyword extraction to assess both video caption and video QA data quality. Additionally, we incorporate frame sampling and rescaling techniques to enhance the efficiency and robustness of our evaluation, this enables our score to evaluate the quality of extremely long videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance (32.8 for Kendall correlation and 42.3 for Spearman correlation, 4.7 and 5.9 higher than the previous method PAC-S++) on the VATEX-EVAL benchmark for video caption evaluation. Furthermore, by using EVQAScore for data selection, we achieved SOTA results with only 12.5\% of the original data volume, outperforming the previous SOTA method PAC-S and 100\% of data.
