Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Online Overexposed Pixels Hallucination in Videos with Adaptive Reference Frame Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15462v1.pdf
Summary: Low dynamic range (LDR) cameras cannot deal with wide dynamic range inputs, frequently leading to local overexposure issues. We present a learning-based system to reduce these artifacts without resorting to complex acquisition mechanisms like alternating exposures or costly processing that are typical of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. We propose a transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) to infer the missing HDR details. In an ablation study, we show the importance of using a multiscale DNN and train it with the proper cost function to achieve state-of-the-art quality. To aid the reconstruction of the overexposed areas, our DNN takes a reference frame from the past as an additional input. This leverages the commonly occurring temporal instabilities of autoexposure to our advantage: since well-exposed details in the current frame may be overexposed in the future, we use reinforcement learning to train a reference frame selection DNN that decides whether to adopt the current frame as a future reference. Without resorting to alternating exposures, we obtain therefore a causal, HDR hallucination algorithm with potential application in common video acquisition settings.

Model: AdaCM$^2$: On Understanding Extremely Long-Term Video with Adaptive Cross-Modality Memory Reduction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12593v1.pdf
Summary: The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled the improvement of video understanding tasks by incorporating LLMs with visual models. However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.
