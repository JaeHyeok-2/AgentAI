Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: ImageNet-Hard: The Hardest Images Remaining from a Study of the Power of Zoom and Spatial Biases in Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05538v4.pdf
Summary: Image classifiers are information-discarding machines, by design. Yet, how these models discard information remains mysterious. We hypothesize that one way for image classifiers to reach high accuracy is to first zoom to the most discriminative region in the image and then extract features from there to predict image labels, discarding the rest of the image. Studying six popular networks ranging from AlexNet to CLIP, we find that proper framing of the input image can lead to the correct classification of 98.91% of ImageNet images. Furthermore, we uncover positional biases in various datasets, especially a strong center bias in two popular datasets: ImageNet-A and ObjectNet. Finally, leveraging our insights into the potential of zooming, we propose a test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions. Our method is more interpretable, accurate, and faster than MEMO, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTA method. We introduce ImageNet-Hard, a new benchmark that challenges SOTA classifiers including large vision-language models even when optimal zooming is allowed.

Model: Speeding Up Image Classifiers with Little Companions
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17117v2.pdf
Summary: Scaling up neural networks has been a key recipe to the success of large language and vision models. However, in practice, up-scaled models can be disproportionately costly in terms of computations, providing only marginal improvements in performance; for example, EfficientViT-L3-384 achieves <2% improvement on ImageNet-1K accuracy over the base L1-224 model, while requiring $14\times$ more multiply-accumulate operations (MACs). In this paper, we investigate scaling properties of popular families of neural networks for image classification, and find that scaled-up models mostly help with "difficult" samples. Decomposing the samples by difficulty, we develop a simple model-agnostic two-pass Little-Big algorithm that first uses a light-weight "little" model to make predictions of all samples, and only passes the difficult ones for the "big" model to solve. Good little companion achieve drastic MACs reduction for a wide variety of model families and scales. Without loss of accuracy or modification of existing models, our Little-Big models achieve MACs reductions of 76% for EfficientViT-L3-384, 81% for EfficientNet-B7-600, 71% for DeiT3-L-384 on ImageNet-1K. Little-Big also speeds up the InternImage-G-512 model by 62% while achieving 90% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy, serving both as a strong baseline and as a simple practical method for large model compression.
