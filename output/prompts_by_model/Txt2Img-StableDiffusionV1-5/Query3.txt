Model: Human and AI Perceptual Differences in Image Classification Errors
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08733v2.pdf
Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) models for computer vision trained with supervised machine learning are assumed to solve classification tasks by imitating human behavior learned from training labels. Most efforts in recent vision research focus on measuring the model task performance using standardized benchmarks such as accuracy. However, limited work has sought to understand the perceptual difference between humans and machines. To fill this gap, this study first analyzes the statistical distributions of mistakes from the two sources and then explores how task difficulty level affects these distributions. We find that even when AI learns an excellent model from the training data, one that outperforms humans in overall accuracy, these AI models have significant and consistent differences from human perception. We demonstrate the importance of studying these differences with a simple human-AI teaming algorithm that outperforms humans alone, AI alone, or AI-AI teaming.

Model: Robustness Evaluation of Offline Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control Against Action Perturbations
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18781v1.pdf
Summary: Offline reinforcement learning, which learns solely from datasets without environmental interaction, has gained attention. This approach, similar to traditional online deep reinforcement learning, is particularly promising for robot control applications. Nevertheless, its robustness against real-world challenges, such as joint actuator faults in robots, remains a critical concern. This study evaluates the robustness of existing offline reinforcement learning methods using legged robots from OpenAI Gym based on average episodic rewards. For robustness evaluation, we simulate failures by incorporating both random and adversarial perturbations, representing worst-case scenarios, into the joint torque signals. Our experiments show that existing offline reinforcement learning methods exhibit significant vulnerabilities to these action perturbations and are more vulnerable than online reinforcement learning methods, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in this field.

Model: LLMs-as-Instructors: Learning from Errors Toward Automating Model Improvement
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00497v1.pdf
Summary: This paper introduces the innovative "LLMs-as-Instructors" framework, which leverages the advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously enhance the training of smaller target models. Inspired by the theory of "Learning from Errors", this framework employs an instructor LLM to meticulously analyze the specific errors within a target model, facilitating targeted and efficient training cycles. Within this framework, we implement two strategies: "Learning from Error," which focuses solely on incorrect responses to tailor training data, and "Learning from Error by Contrast", which uses contrastive learning to analyze both correct and incorrect responses for a deeper understanding of errors.   Our empirical studies, conducted with several open-source models, demonstrate significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning, coding abilities, and factual knowledge. Notably, the refined Llama-3-8b-Instruction has outperformed ChatGPT, illustrating the effectiveness of our approach. By leveraging the strengths of both strategies, we have attained a more balanced performance improvement on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.
