You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I prompted a cartoon character reading a comic, and even the fingers looked natural. Earlier versions used to mess that up. How did they fix this?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10320v3.pdf
Summary: We recover the underlying 3D structure from images of cartoons and anime depicting the same scene. This is an interesting problem domain because images in creative media are often depicted without explicit geometric consistency for storytelling and creative expression-they are only 3D in a qualitative sense. While humans can easily perceive the underlying 3D scene from these images, existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods that assume 3D consistency fail catastrophically. We present Toon3D for reconstructing geometrically inconsistent images. Our key insight is to deform the input images while recovering camera poses and scene geometry, effectively explaining away geometrical inconsistencies to achieve consistency. This process is guided by the structure inferred from monocular depth predictions. We curate a dataset with multi-view imagery from cartoons and anime that we annotate with reliable sparse correspondences using our user-friendly annotation tool. Our recovered point clouds can be plugged into novel-view synthesis methods to experience cartoons from viewpoints never drawn before. We evaluate against classical and recent learning-based SfM methods, where Toon3D is able to obtain more reliable camera poses and scene geometry.

Model: Unlocking Comics: The AI4VA Dataset for Visual Understanding

Summary: In the evolving landscape of deep learning, there is a pressing need for more comprehensive datasets capable of training models across multiple modalities. Concurrently, in digital humanities, there is a growing demand to leverage technology for diverse media adaptation and creation, yet limited by sparse datasets due to copyright and stylistic constraints. Addressing this gap, our paper presents a novel dataset comprising Franco-Belgian comics from the 1950s annotated for tasks including depth estimation, semantic segmentation, saliency detection, and character identification. It consists of two distinct and consistent styles and incorporates object concepts and labels taken from natural images. By including such diverse information across styles, this dataset not only holds promise for computational creativity but also offers avenues for the digitization of art and storytelling innovation. This dataset is a crucial component of the AI4VA Workshop Challenges~\url{https://sites.google.com/view/ai4vaeccv2024}, where we specifically explore depth and saliency.

Model: Hi Sheldon! Creating Deep Personalized Characters from TV Shows
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.11093v1.pdf
Summary: Imagine an interesting multimodal interactive scenario that you can see, hear, and chat with an AI-generated digital character, who is capable of behaving like Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory, as a DEEP copy from appearance to personality. Towards this fantastic multimodal chatting scenario, we propose a novel task, named Deep Personalized Character Creation (DPCC): creating multimodal chat personalized characters from multimodal data such as TV shows. Specifically, given a single- or multi-modality input (text, audio, video), the goal of DPCC is to generate a multi-modality (text, audio, video) response, which should be well-matched the personality of a specific character such as Sheldon, and of high quality as well. To support this novel task, we further collect a character centric multimodal dialogue dataset, named Deep Personalized Character Dataset (DPCD), from TV shows. DPCD contains character-specific multimodal dialogue data of ~10k utterances and ~6 hours of audio/video per character, which is around 10 times larger compared to existing related datasets.On DPCD, we present a baseline method for the DPCC task and create 5 Deep personalized digital Characters (DeepCharacters) from Big Bang TV Shows. We conduct both subjective and objective experiments to evaluate the multimodal response from DeepCharacters in terms of characterization and quality. The results demonstrates that, on our collected DPCD dataset, the proposed baseline can create personalized digital characters for generating multimodal response.Our collected DPCD dataset, the code of data collection and our baseline will be published soon.
