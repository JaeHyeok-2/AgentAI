Model: MiniGPT-4: Enhancing Vision-Language Understanding with Advanced Large Language Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10592v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/vision-cair/minigpt-4
Summary: The recent GPT-4 has demonstrated extraordinary multi-modal abilities, such as directly generating websites from handwritten text and identifying humorous elements within images. These features are rarely observed in previous vision-language models. However, the technical details behind GPT-4 continue to remain undisclosed. We believe that the enhanced multi-modal generation capabilities of GPT-4 stem from the utilization of sophisticated large language models (LLM). To examine this phenomenon, we present MiniGPT-4, which aligns a frozen visual encoder with a frozen advanced LLM, Vicuna, using one projection layer. Our work, for the first time, uncovers that properly aligning the visual features with an advanced large language model can possess numerous advanced multi-modal abilities demonstrated by GPT-4, such as detailed image description generation and website creation from hand-drawn drafts. Furthermore, we also observe other emerging capabilities in MiniGPT-4, including writing stories and poems inspired by given images, teaching users how to cook based on food photos, and so on. In our experiment, we found that the model trained on short image caption pairs could produce unnatural language outputs (e.g., repetition and fragmentation). To address this problem, we curate a detailed image description dataset in the second stage to finetune the model, which consequently improves the model's generation reliability and overall usability. Our code, pre-trained model, and collected dataset are available at https://minigpt-4.github.io/.

Model: CoF: Coarse to Fine-Grained Image Understanding for Multi-modal Large Language Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16869v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/gavin001201/cof
Summary: The impressive performance of Large Language Model (LLM) has prompted researchers to develop Multi-modal LLM (MLLM), which has shown great potential for various multi-modal tasks. However, current MLLM often struggles to effectively address fine-grained multi-modal challenges. We argue that this limitation is closely linked to the models' visual grounding capabilities. The restricted spatial awareness and perceptual acuity of visual encoders frequently lead to interference from irrelevant background information in images, causing the models to overlook subtle but crucial details. As a result, achieving fine-grained regional visual comprehension becomes difficult. In this paper, we break down multi-modal understanding into two stages, from Coarse to Fine (CoF). In the first stage, we prompt the MLLM to locate the approximate area of the answer. In the second stage, we further enhance the model's focus on relevant areas within the image through visual prompt engineering, adjusting attention weights of pertinent regions. This, in turn, improves both visual grounding and overall performance in downstream tasks. Our experiments show that this approach significantly boosts the performance of baseline models, demonstrating notable generalization and effectiveness. Our CoF approach is available online at https://github.com/Gavin001201/CoF.

Model: Leveraging Large Language Models for Scalable Vector Graphics-Driven Image Understanding
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06094v2.pdf
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language understanding. However, through that enormous semantic representation that the LLM has learnt, is it somehow possible for it to understand images as well? This work investigates this question. To enable the LLM to process images, we convert them into a representation given by Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). To study what the LLM can do with this XML-based textual description of images, we test the LLM on three broad computer vision tasks: (i) visual reasoning and question answering, (ii) image classification under distribution shift, few-shot learning, and (iii) generating new images using visual prompting. Even though we do not naturally associate LLMs with any visual understanding capabilities, our results indicate that the LLM can often do a decent job in many of these tasks, potentially opening new avenues for research into LLMs' ability to understand image data.
