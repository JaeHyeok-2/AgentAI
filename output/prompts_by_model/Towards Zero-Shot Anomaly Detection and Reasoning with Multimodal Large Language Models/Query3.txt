Model: Enhancing universal machine learning potentials with polarizable long-range interactions
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13820v1.pdf

Summary: Long-range interactions are crucial in determining the behavior of chemical systems in various environments. Accurate predictions of physical and chemical phenomena at the atomic level hinge on accurate modeling of these interactions. Here, we present a framework that substantially enhances the predictive power of machine learning interatomic potentials by incorporating explicit polarizable long-range interactions with an equivariant graph neural network short-range potential. The pretrained universal model, applicable across the entire periodic table, can achieve first-principles accuracy. This versatile model has been further applied to diverse areas of research, including the study of mechanical properties, ionic diffusivity in solid-state electrolytes, ferroelectricity, and interfacial reactions, demonstrating its broad applicability and robustness.

Model: Adaptive Activation Functions for Predictive Modeling with Sparse Experimental Data
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05401v1.pdf

Summary: A pivotal aspect in the design of neural networks lies in selecting activation functions, crucial for introducing nonlinear structures that capture intricate input-output patterns. While the effectiveness of adaptive or trainable activation functions has been studied in domains with ample data, like image classification problems, significant gaps persist in understanding their influence on classification accuracy and predictive uncertainty in settings characterized by limited data availability. This research aims to address these gaps by investigating the use of two types of adaptive activation functions. These functions incorporate shared and individual trainable parameters per hidden layer and are examined in three testbeds derived from additive manufacturing problems containing fewer than one hundred training instances. Our investigation reveals that adaptive activation functions, such as Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) and Softplus, with individual trainable parameters, result in accurate and confident prediction models that outperform fixed-shape activation functions and the less flexible method of using identical trainable activation functions in a hidden layer. Therefore, this work presents an elegant way of facilitating the design of adaptive neural networks in scientific and engineering problems.

Model: Robust agents learn causal world models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10877v7.pdf
Summary: It has long been hypothesised that causal reasoning plays a fundamental role in robust and general intelligence. However, it is not known if agents must learn causal models in order to generalise to new domains, or if other inductive biases are sufficient. We answer this question, showing that any agent capable of satisfying a regret bound under a large set of distributional shifts must have learned an approximate causal model of the data generating process, which converges to the true causal model for optimal agents. We discuss the implications of this result for several research areas including transfer learning and causal inference.
