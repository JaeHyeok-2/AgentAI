Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03876v1.pdf
Summary: Anomaly detection based on 3D point cloud data is an important research problem and receives more and more attention recently. Untrained anomaly detection based on only one sample is an emerging research problem motivated by real manufacturing industries such as personalized manufacturing that only one sample can be collected without any additional labels. How to accurately identify anomalies based on one 3D point cloud sample is a critical challenge in both industrial applications and the field of machine learning. This paper aims to provide a formal definition of untrained anomaly detection problem based on 3D point cloud data, discuss the differences between untrained anomaly detection and current unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Unlike unsupervised learning, untrained methods do not rely on any data, including unlabeled data. Instead, they leverage prior knowledge about the manufacturing surfaces and anomalies. Examples are used to illustrate these prior knowledge and untrained machine learning model. Afterwards, literature review on untrained anomaly detection based on 3D point cloud data is also provided, and the potential of untrained deep neural networks for anomaly detection is also discussed as outlooks.

Model: Self-Supervised Time-Series Anomaly Detection Using Learnable Data Augmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12260v1.pdf
Summary: Continuous efforts are being made to advance anomaly detection in various manufacturing processes to increase the productivity and safety of industrial sites. Deep learning replaced rule-based methods and recently emerged as a promising method for anomaly detection in diverse industries. However, in the real world, the scarcity of abnormal data and difficulties in obtaining labeled data create limitations in the training of detection models. In this study, we addressed these shortcomings by proposing a learnable data augmentation-based time-series anomaly detection (LATAD) technique that is trained in a self-supervised manner. LATAD extracts discriminative features from time-series data through contrastive learning. At the same time, learnable data augmentation produces challenging negative samples to enhance learning efficiency. We measured anomaly scores of the proposed technique based on latent feature similarities. As per the results, LATAD exhibited comparable or improved performance to the state-of-the-art anomaly detection assessments on several benchmark datasets and provided a gradient-based diagnosis technique to help identify root causes.

Model: AnomalousPatchCore: Exploring the Use of Anomalous Samples in Industrial Anomaly Detection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15113v2.pdf
Summary: Visual inspection, or industrial anomaly detection, is one of the most common quality control types in manufacturing. The task is to identify the presence of an anomaly given an image, e.g., a missing component on an image of a circuit board, for subsequent manual inspection. While industrial anomaly detection has seen a surge in recent years, most anomaly detection methods still utilize knowledge only from normal samples, failing to leverage the information from the frequently available anomalous samples. Additionally, they heavily rely on very general feature extractors pre-trained on common image classification datasets. In this paper, we address these shortcomings and propose the new anomaly detection system AnomalousPatchCore~(APC) based on a feature extractor fine-tuned with normal and anomalous in-domain samples and a subsequent memory bank for identifying unusual features. To fine-tune the feature extractor in APC, we propose three auxiliary tasks that address the different aspects of anomaly detection~(classification vs. localization) and mitigate the effect of the imbalance between normal and anomalous samples. Our extensive evaluation on the MVTec dataset shows that APC outperforms state-of-the-art systems in detecting anomalies, which is especially important in industrial anomaly detection given the subsequent manual inspection. In detailed ablation studies, we further investigate the properties of our APC.
