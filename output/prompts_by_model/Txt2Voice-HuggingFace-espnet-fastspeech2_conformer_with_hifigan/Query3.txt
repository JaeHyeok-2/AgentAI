You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"It read my sentence smoothly, like a human would. What stages does it go through to turn plain text into expressive, realistic speech?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: SparQLe: Speech Queries to Text Translation Through LLMs
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09284v1.pdf
Summary: With the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in integrating speech representations with them to enable more seamless multi-modal processing and speech understanding. This study introduces a novel approach that combines self-supervised speech representations with instruction-tuned LLMs for speech-to-text translation. The proposed approach leverages a modality adapter to align extracted speech features with instruction-tuned LLMs using English speech data. Our experiments demonstrate that this method effectively preserves the semantic content of the input speech and serves as an effective bridge between self-supervised speech models and instruction-tuned LLMs, offering a promising approach for various speech understanding applications.

Model: Investigating the Timescales of Language Processing with EEG and Language Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19884v2.pdf
Summary: This study explores the temporal dynamics of language processing by examining the alignment between word representations from a pre-trained transformer-based language model, and EEG data. Using a Temporal Response Function (TRF) model, we investigate how neural activity corresponds to model representations across different layers, revealing insights into the interaction between artificial language models and brain responses during language comprehension. Our analysis reveals patterns in TRFs from distinct layers, highlighting varying contributions to lexical and compositional processing. Additionally, we used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to isolate part-of-speech (POS) representations, offering insights into their influence on neural responses and the underlying mechanisms of syntactic processing. These findings underscore EEG's utility for probing language processing dynamics with high temporal resolution. By bridging artificial language models and neural activity, this study advances our understanding of their interaction at fine timescales.

Model: Sequential annotations for naturally-occurring HRI: first insights
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15097v1.pdf
Summary: We explain the methodology we developed for improving the interactions accomplished by an embedded conversational agent, drawing from Conversation Analytic sequential and multimodal analysis. The use case is a Pepper robot that is expected to inform and orient users in a library. In order to propose and learn better interactive schema, we are creating a corpus of naturally-occurring interactions that will be made available to the community. To do so, we propose an annotation practice based on some theoretical underpinnings about the use of language and multimodal resources in human-robot interaction.
