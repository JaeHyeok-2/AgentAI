You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"Even without punctuation, the AI added pauses and natural pitch changes. How does it know where to place emphasis just from the words?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: Via thousands of papers in Explainable AI (XAI), attention maps \cite{vaswani2017attention} and feature importance maps \cite{bansal2020sam} have been established as a common means for finding how important each input feature is to an AI's decisions. It is an interesting, unexplored question whether allowing users to edit the feature importance at test time would improve a human-AI team's accuracy on downstream tasks. In this paper, we address this question by leveraging CHM-Corr, a state-of-the-art, ante-hoc explainable classifier \cite{taesiri2022visual} that first predicts patch-wise correspondences between the input and training-set images, and then bases on them to make classification decisions. We build CHM-Corr++, an interactive interface for CHM-Corr, enabling users to edit the feature importance map provided by CHM-Corr and observe updated model decisions. Via CHM-Corr++, users can gain insights into if, when, and how the model changes its outputs, improving their understanding beyond static explanations. However, our study with 18 expert users who performed 1,400 decisions finds no statistical significance that our interactive approach improves user accuracy on CUB-200 bird image classification over static explanations. This challenges the hypothesis that interactivity can boost human-AI team accuracy and raises needs for future research. We open-source CHM-Corr++, an interactive tool for editing image classifier attention (see an interactive demo here: http://137.184.82.109:7080/). We release code and data on github: https://github.com/anguyen8/chm-corr-interactive.

Model: AI Coach Assist: An Automated Approach for Call Recommendation in Contact Centers for Agent Coaching
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17619v1.pdf
Summary: In recent years, the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the contact center industry is on the rise. One area where AI can have a significant impact is in the coaching of contact center agents. By analyzing call transcripts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it would be possible to quickly determine which calls are most relevant for coaching purposes. In this paper, we present AI Coach Assist, which leverages the pre-trained transformer-based language models to determine whether a given call is coachable or not based on the quality assurance (QA) questions asked by the contact center managers or supervisors. The system was trained and evaluated on a large dataset collected from real-world contact centers and provides an effective way to recommend calls to the contact center managers that are more likely to contain coachable moments. Our experimental findings demonstrate the potential of AI Coach Assist to improve the coaching process, resulting in enhancing the performance of contact center agents.

Model: Sequential annotations for naturally-occurring HRI: first insights
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15097v1.pdf
Summary: We explain the methodology we developed for improving the interactions accomplished by an embedded conversational agent, drawing from Conversation Analytic sequential and multimodal analysis. The use case is a Pepper robot that is expected to inform and orient users in a library. In order to propose and learn better interactive schema, we are creating a corpus of naturally-occurring interactions that will be made available to the community. To do so, we propose an annotation practice based on some theoretical underpinnings about the use of language and multimodal resources in human-robot interaction.
