Model: GPU-Accelerated LOD Generation for Point Clouds
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14801v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/m-schuetz/cudalod
Summary: About: We introduce a GPU-accelerated LOD construction process that creates a hybrid voxel-point-based variation of the widely used layered point cloud (LPC) structure for LOD rendering and streaming. The massive performance improvements provided by the GPU allow us to improve the quality of lower LODs via color filtering while still increasing construction speed compared to the non-filtered, CPU-based state of the art.   Background: LOD structures are required to render hundreds of millions to trillions of points, but constructing them takes time.   Results: LOD structures suitable for rendering and streaming are constructed at rates of about 1 billion points per second (with color filtering) to 4 billion points per second (sample-picking/random sampling, state of the art) on an RTX 3090 -- an improvement of a factor of 80 to 400 times over the CPU-based state of the art (12 million points per second). Due to being in-core, model sizes are limited to about 500 million points per 24GB memory.   Discussion: Our method currently focuses on maximizing in-core construction speed on the GPU. Issues such as out-of-core construction of arbitrarily large data sets are not addressed, but we expect it to be suitable as a component of bottom-up out-of-core LOD construction schemes.

Model: Mirage: Towards Low-interruption Services on Batch GPU Clusters with Reinforcement Learning
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.14086v1.pdf

Summary: Accommodating long-running deep learning (DL) training and inference jobs is challenging on GPU clusters that use traditional batch schedulers, such as Slurm. Given fixed wall clock time limits, DL researchers usually need to run a sequence of batch jobs and experience long interruptions on overloaded machines. Such interruptions significantly lower the research productivity and QoS for services that are deployed in production. To mitigate the issues from interruption, we investigate a set of statistical learning and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, including random forest, xgboost, Deep Q-Network, and policy gradient to design a proactive provisioner using production job traces from three GPU clusters. We follow the standard machine learning practice by partitioning each job trace into training and validation subsets, then train each model using the training subset and evaluate the generality using the validation subset. We introduce Mirage, a Slurm-compatible resource provisioner that integrates the candidate RL methods. Our experiments show that the Mirage can reduce the interruption by 17-100% and safeguard 23%-76% of jobs with zero interruption across varying load levels on the three clusters.

Model: Understand Waiting Time in Transaction Fee Mechanism: An Interdisciplinary Perspective
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02552v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/cs-econ-blockchain/waiting-time-eip1559
Summary: Blockchain enables peer-to-peer transactions in cyberspace without a trusted third party. The rapid growth of Ethereum and smart contract blockchains generally calls for well-designed Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) to allocate limited storage and computation resources. However, existing research on TFMs must consider the waiting time for transactions, which is essential for computer security and economic efficiency. Integrating data from the Ethereum blockchain and memory pool (mempool), we explore how two types of events affect transaction latency. First, we apply regression discontinuity design (RDD) to study the causal inference of the Merge, the most recent significant upgrade of Ethereum. Our results show that the Merge significantly reduces the long waiting time, network loads, and market congestion. In addition, we verify our results' robustness by inspecting other compounding factors, such as censorship and unobserved delays of transactions via private changes. Second, examining three major protocol changes during the merge, we identify block interval shortening as the most plausible cause for our empirical results. Furthermore, in a mathematical model, we show block interval as a unique mechanism design choice for EIP1559 TFM to achieve better security and efficiency, generally applicable to the market congestion caused by demand surges. Finally, we apply time series analysis to research the interaction of Non-Fungible token (NFT) drops and market congestion using Facebook Prophet, an open-source algorithm for generating time-series models. Our study identified NFT drops as a unique source of market congestion -- holiday effects -- beyond trend and season effects. Finally, we envision three future research directions of TFM.
