Model: FlowDCN: Exploring DCN-like Architectures for Fast Image Generation with Arbitrary Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22655v1.pdf
Summary: Arbitrary-resolution image generation still remains a challenging task in AIGC, as it requires handling varying resolutions and aspect ratios while maintaining high visual quality. Existing transformer-based diffusion methods suffer from quadratic computation cost and limited resolution extrapolation capabilities, making them less effective for this task. In this paper, we propose FlowDCN, a purely convolution-based generative model with linear time and memory complexity, that can efficiently generate high-quality images at arbitrary resolutions. Equipped with a new design of learnable group-wise deformable convolution block, our FlowDCN yields higher flexibility and capability to handle different resolutions with a single model. FlowDCN achieves the state-of-the-art 4.30 sFID on $256\times256$ ImageNet Benchmark and comparable resolution extrapolation results, surpassing transformer-based counterparts in terms of convergence speed (only $\frac{1}{5}$ images), visual quality, parameters ($8\%$ reduction) and FLOPs ($20\%$ reduction). We believe FlowDCN offers a promising solution to scalable and flexible image synthesis.

Model: Generative AI Beyond LLMs: System Implications of Multi-Modal Generation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14385v2.pdf
Summary: As the development of large-scale Generative AI models evolve beyond text (1D) generation to include image (2D) and video (3D) generation, processing spatial and temporal information presents unique challenges to quality, performance, and efficiency. We present the first work towards understanding this new system design space for multi-modal text-to-image (TTI) and text-to-video (TTV) generation models. Current model architecture designs are bifurcated into 2 categories: Diffusion- and Transformer-based models. Our systematic performance characterization on a suite of eight representative TTI/TTV models shows that after state-of-the-art optimization techniques such as Flash Attention are applied, Convolution accounts for up to 44% of execution time for Diffusion-based TTI models, while Linear layers consume up to 49% of execution time for Transformer-based models. We additionally observe that Diffusion-based TTI models resemble the Prefill stage of LLM inference, and benefit from 1.1-2.5x greater speedup from Flash Attention than Transformer-based TTI models that resemble the Decode phase. Since optimizations designed for LLMs do not map directly onto TTI/TTV models, we must conduct a thorough characterization of these workloads to gain insights for new optimization opportunities. In doing so, we define sequence length in the context of TTI/TTV models and observe sequence length can vary up to 4x in Diffusion model inference. We additionally observe temporal aspects of TTV workloads pose unique system bottlenecks, with Temporal Attention accounting for over 60% of total Attention time. Overall, our in-depth system performance characterization is a critical first step towards designing efficient and deployable systems for emerging TTI/TTV workloads.

Model: InstanceDiffusion: Instance-level Control for Image Generation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03290v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/frank-xwang/InstanceDiffusion
Summary: Text-to-image diffusion models produce high quality images but do not offer control over individual instances in the image. We introduce InstanceDiffusion that adds precise instance-level control to text-to-image diffusion models. InstanceDiffusion supports free-form language conditions per instance and allows flexible ways to specify instance locations such as simple single points, scribbles, bounding boxes or intricate instance segmentation masks, and combinations thereof. We propose three major changes to text-to-image models that enable precise instance-level control. Our UniFusion block enables instance-level conditions for text-to-image models, the ScaleU block improves image fidelity, and our Multi-instance Sampler improves generations for multiple instances. InstanceDiffusion significantly surpasses specialized state-of-the-art models for each location condition. Notably, on the COCO dataset, we outperform previous state-of-the-art by 20.4% AP$_{50}^\text{box}$ for box inputs, and 25.4% IoU for mask inputs.
