A user has asked the following question:
"Started generating high-res images from prompts, and it was done way faster than usual—even on my GPU. How is it speeding that up so much without new hardware?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

Model: Iteratively Prompting Multimodal LLMs to Reproduce Natural and AI-Generated Images
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13784v1.pdf
Summary: With the digital imagery landscape rapidly evolving, image stocks and AI-generated image marketplaces have become central to visual media. Traditional stock images now exist alongside innovative platforms that trade in prompts for AI-generated visuals, driven by sophisticated APIs like DALL-E 3 and Midjourney. This paper studies the possibility of employing multi-modal models with enhanced visual understanding to mimic the outputs of these platforms, introducing an original attack strategy. Our method leverages fine-tuned CLIP models, a multi-label classifier, and the descriptive capabilities of GPT-4V to create prompts that generate images similar to those available in marketplaces and from premium stock image providers, yet at a markedly lower expense. In presenting this strategy, we aim to spotlight a new class of economic and security considerations within the realm of digital imagery. Our findings, supported by both automated metrics and human assessment, reveal that comparable visual content can be produced for a fraction of the prevailing market prices ($0.23 - $0.27 per image), emphasizing the need for awareness and strategic discussions about the integrity of digital media in an increasingly AI-integrated landscape. Our work also contributes to the field by assembling a dataset consisting of approximately 19 million prompt-image pairs generated by the popular Midjourney platform, which we plan to release publicly.

Model: WorldSmith: Iterative and Expressive Prompting for World Building with a Generative AI
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13355v1.pdf
Summary: Crafting a rich and unique environment is crucial for fictional world-building, but can be difficult to achieve since illustrating a world from scratch requires time and significant skill. We investigate the use of recent multi-modal image generation systems to enable users iteratively visualize and modify elements of their fictional world using a combination of text input, sketching, and region-based filling. WorldSmith enables novice world builders to quickly visualize a fictional world with layered edits and hierarchical compositions. Through a formative study (4 participants) and first-use study (13 participants) we demonstrate that WorldSmith offers more expressive interactions with prompt-based models. With this work, we explore how creatives can be empowered to leverage prompt-based generative AI as a tool in their creative process, beyond current "click-once" prompting UI paradigms.

Model: Human-Guided Image Generation for Expanding Small-Scale Training Image Datasets
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16839v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/hnu-vis/datacrafter
Summary: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications (e.g., rare wildlife observation) is limited by the small number of available images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective way to address this limitation. However, since the automatic generation process is uncontrollable, the generated images are usually limited in diversity, and some of them are undesired. In this paper, we propose a human-guided image generation method for more controllable dataset expansion. We develop a multi-modal projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate the exploration of both the original and generated images. Based on the exploration, users refine the prompts and re-generate images for better performance. Since directly refining the prompts is challenging for novice users, we develop a sample-level prompt refinement method to make it easier. With this method, users only need to provide sample-level feedback (e.g., which samples are undesired) to obtain better prompts. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the multi-modal projection method, improved model performance in the case study for both classification and object detection tasks, and positive feedback from the experts.
