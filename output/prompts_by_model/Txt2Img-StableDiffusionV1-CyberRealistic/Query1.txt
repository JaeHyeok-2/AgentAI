You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I typed “person wearing a futuristic jacket,” and the fabric looked like real leather while the lighting felt straight out of a sci-fi movie. How does AI keep things realistic yet add that sci-fi vibe—what extra cues is it calculating?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled a comprehensive exploration of materials for various applications. However, AI models often prioritize frequently encountered materials in the scientific literature, limiting the selection of suitable candidates based on inherent physical and chemical properties. To address this imbalance, we have generated a dataset of 1,494,017 natural language-material paragraphs based on combined OQMD, Materials Project, JARVIS, COD and AFLOW2 databases, which are dominated by ab initio calculations and tend to be much more evenly distributed on the periodic table. The generated text narratives were then polled and scored by both human experts and ChatGPT-4, based on three rubrics: technical accuracy, language and structure, and relevance and depth of content, showing similar scores but with human-scored depth of content being the most lagging. The merger of multi-modality data sources and large language model (LLM) holds immense potential for AI frameworks to help the exploration and discovery of solid-state materials for specific applications.

Model: Artificial Intelligence and Aesthetic Judgment
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12338v1.pdf
Summary: Generative AIs produce creative outputs in the style of human expression. We argue that encounters with the outputs of modern generative AI models are mediated by the same kinds of aesthetic judgments that organize our interactions with artwork. The interpretation procedure we use on art we find in museums is not an innate human faculty, but one developed over history by disciplines such as art history and art criticism to fulfill certain social functions. This gives us pause when considering our reactions to generative AI, how we should approach this new medium, and why generative AI seems to incite so much fear about the future. We naturally inherit a conundrum of causal inference from the history of art: a work can be read as a symptom of the cultural conditions that influenced its creation while simultaneously being framed as a timeless, seemingly acausal distillation of an eternal human condition. In this essay, we focus on an unresolved tension when we bring this dilemma to bear in the context of generative AI: are we looking for proof that generated media reflects something about the conditions that created it or some eternal human essence? Are current modes of interpretation sufficient for this task? Historically, new forms of art have changed how art is interpreted, with such influence used as evidence that a work of art has touched some essential human truth. As generative AI influences contemporary aesthetic judgment we outline some of the pitfalls and traps in attempting to scrutinize what AI generated media means.

Model: FaGeL: Fabric LLMs Agent empowered Embodied Intelligence Evolution with Autonomous Human-Machine Collaboration
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20297v1.pdf
Summary: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents, driving progress toward AGI-powered robotics. While LLMs have been applied to tasks like semantic reasoning and task generalization, their potential in open physical space exploration remains underexplored. This paper introduces FaGeL (Fabric aGent empowered by embodied intelligence with LLMs), an embodied agent integrating smart fabric technology for seamless, non-intrusive human-agent interaction. FaGeL autonomously generates tasks using multimodal data from wearable and ambient sensors, refining its behavior based on implicit human feedback in generated text, without explicit ratings or preferences. We also introduce a token-level saliency map to visualize LLM fine-tuning, enhancing the interpretability of token-level alignment. The system leverages dual feedback mechanisms to improve token-level alignment and addresses challenges in non-intrusive human-machine interaction and cognition evolution. Our contributions include FaGeL's development, the DualCUT algorithm for AI alignment, and experimental validation in cooperative tasks, demonstrating FaGeL's ability to adapt and evolve autonomously through implicit feedback. In the future, we plan to explore FaGeL's scalability in dynamic environments and its integration with other AI systems to develop AGI agents that adapt seamlessly to diverse human needs.
