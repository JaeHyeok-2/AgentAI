You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I tried generating captions automatically using AI and was amazed at how accurate and detailed they were. What kind of information does the AI extract from images to produce such natural sentences? What datasets are image caption models trained on?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00252v1.pdf
Summary: While supervised learning has achieved significant success in computer vision tasks, acquiring high-quality annotated data remains a bottleneck. This paper explores both scholarly and non-scholarly works in AI-assistive deep learning image annotation systems that provide textual suggestions, captions, or descriptions of the input image to the annotator. This potentially results in higher annotation efficiency and quality. Our exploration covers annotation for a range of computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection, regression, instance, semantic segmentation, and pose estimation. We review various datasets and how they contribute to the training and evaluation of AI-assistive annotation systems. We also examine methods leveraging neuro-symbolic learning, deep active learning, and self-supervised learning algorithms that enable semantic image understanding and generate free-text output. These include image captioning, visual question answering, and multi-modal reasoning. Despite the promising potential, there is limited publicly available work on AI-assistive image annotation with textual output capabilities. We conclude by suggesting future research directions to advance this field, emphasizing the need for more publicly accessible datasets and collaborative efforts between academia and industry.

Model: IFCap: Image-like Retrieval and Frequency-based Entity Filtering for Zero-shot Captioning
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18046v1.pdf

Summary: Recent advancements in image captioning have explored text-only training methods to overcome the limitations of paired image-text data. However, existing text-only training methods often overlook the modality gap between using text data during training and employing images during inference. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Image-like Retrieval, which aligns text features with visually relevant features to mitigate the modality gap. Our method further enhances the accuracy of generated captions by designing a Fusion Module that integrates retrieved captions with input features. Additionally, we introduce a Frequency-based Entity Filtering technique that significantly improves caption quality. We integrate these methods into a unified framework, which we refer to as IFCap ($\textbf{I}$mage-like Retrieval and $\textbf{F}$requency-based Entity Filtering for Zero-shot $\textbf{Cap}$tioning). Through extensive experimentation, our straightforward yet powerful approach has demonstrated its efficacy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in both image captioning and video captioning compared to zero-shot captioning based on text-only training.
