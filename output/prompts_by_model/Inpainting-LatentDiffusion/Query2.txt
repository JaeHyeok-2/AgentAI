You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I tried restoring a damaged photo with missing pieces and stains using AI, and the missing areas were filled in very realistically. How does the AI predict and reconstruct the missing parts so convincingly? What data are these inpainting models trained on, and what technologies are popular nowadays?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Summary: Recent advancements in generative AI have made text-guided image inpainting -- adding, removing, or altering image regions using textual prompts -- widely accessible. However, generating semantically correct photorealistic imagery, typically requires carefully-crafted prompts and iterative refinement by evaluating the realism of the generated content - tasks commonly performed by humans. To automate the generative process, we propose Semantically Aligned and Uncertainty Guided AI Image Inpainting (SAGI), a model-agnostic pipeline, to sample prompts from a distribution that closely aligns with human perception and to evaluate the generated content and discard one that deviates from such a distribution, which we approximate using pretrained Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models. By applying this pipeline on multiple state-of-the-art inpainting models, we create the SAGI Dataset (SAGI-D), currently the largest and most diverse dataset of AI-generated inpaintings, comprising over 95k inpainted images and a human-evaluated subset. Our experiments show that semantic alignment significantly improves image quality and aesthetics, while uncertainty guidance effectively identifies realistic manipulations - human ability to distinguish inpainted images from real ones drops from 74% to 35% in terms of accuracy, after applying our pipeline. Moreover, using SAGI-D for training several image forensic approaches increases in-domain detection performance on average by 37.4% and out-of-domain generalization by 26.1% in terms of IoU, also demonstrating its utility in countering malicious exploitation of generative AI.

Model: Blind Inpainting with Object-aware Discrimination for Artificial Marker Removal
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15124v2.pdf
Summary: Medical images often incorporate doctor-added markers that can hinder AI-based diagnosis. This issue highlights the need of inpainting techniques to restore the corrupted visual contents. However, existing methods require manual mask annotation as input, limiting the application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel blind inpainting method that automatically reconstructs visual contents within the corrupted regions without mask input as guidance. Our model includes a blind reconstruction network and an object-aware discriminator for adversarial training. The reconstruction network contains two branches that predict corrupted regions in images and simultaneously restore the missing visual contents. Leveraging the potent recognition capability of a dense object detector, the object-aware discriminator ensures markers undetectable after inpainting. Thus, the restored images closely resemble the clean ones. We evaluate our method on three datasets of various medical imaging modalities, confirming better performance over other state-of-the-art methods.

Model: Cultural Heritage 3D Reconstruction with Diffusion Networks
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10927v1.pdf

Summary: This article explores the use of recent generative AI algorithms for repairing cultural heritage objects, leveraging a conditional diffusion model designed to reconstruct 3D point clouds effectively. Our study evaluates the model's performance across general and cultural heritage-specific settings. Results indicate that, with considerations for object variability, the diffusion model can accurately reproduce cultural heritage geometries. Despite encountering challenges like data diversity and outlier sensitivity, the model demonstrates significant potential in artifact restoration research. This work lays groundwork for advancing restoration methodologies for ancient artifacts using AI technologies.
