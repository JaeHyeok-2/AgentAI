Summary: Through prompting, large-scale pre-trained models have become more expressive and powerful, gaining significant attention in recent years. Though these big models have zero-shot capabilities, in general, labeled data are still required to adapt them to downstream tasks. To overcome this critical limitation, we propose an unsupervised fine-tuning framework to directly fine-tune the model or prompt on the unlabeled target data. We demonstrate how to apply our method to both language-augmented vision and masked-language models by aligning the discrete distributions extracted from the prompts and target data. To verify our approach's applicability, we conduct extensive experiments on image classification, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference tasks. Across 13 image-related tasks and 15 language-related ones, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements over the baselines.

Model: TIAM -- A Metric for Evaluating Alignment in Text-to-Image Generation

Summary: The progress in the generation of synthetic images has made it crucial to assess their quality. While several metrics have been proposed to assess the rendering of images, it is crucial for Text-to-Image (T2I) models, which generate images based on a prompt, to consider additional aspects such as to which extent the generated image matches the important content of the prompt. Moreover, although the generated images usually result from a random starting point, the influence of this one is generally not considered. In this article, we propose a new metric based on prompt templates to study the alignment between the content specified in the prompt and the corresponding generated images. It allows us to better characterize the alignment in terms of the type of the specified objects, their number, and their color. We conducted a study on several recent T2I models about various aspects. An additional interesting result we obtained with our approach is that image quality can vary drastically depending on the noise used as a seed for the images. We also quantify the influence of the number of concepts in the prompt, their order as well as their (color) attributes. Finally, our method allows us to identify some seeds that produce better images than others, opening novel directions of research on this understudied topic.

Model: Multi-Turn Multi-Modal Question Clarification for Enhanced Conversational Understanding
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11442v1.pdf
Summary: Conversational query clarification enables users to refine their search queries through interactive dialogue, improving search effectiveness. Traditional approaches rely on text-based clarifying questions, which often fail to capture complex user preferences, particularly those involving visual attributes. While recent work has explored single-turn multi-modal clarification with images alongside text, such methods do not fully support the progressive nature of user intent refinement over multiple turns. Motivated by this, we introduce the Multi-turn Multi-modal Clarifying Questions (MMCQ) task, which combines text and visual modalities to refine user queries in a multi-turn conversation. To facilitate this task, we create a large-scale dataset named ClariMM comprising over 13k multi-turn interactions and 33k question-answer pairs containing multi-modal clarifying questions. We propose Mario, a retrieval framework that employs a two-phase ranking strategy: initial retrieval with BM25, followed by a multi-modal generative re-ranking model that integrates textual and visual information from conversational history. Our experiments show that multi-turn multi-modal clarification outperforms uni-modal and single-turn approaches, improving MRR by 12.88%. The gains are most significant in longer interactions, demonstrating the value of progressive refinement for complex queries.
