Model: Unraveling the geometry of visual relational reasoning
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17382v1.pdf
Summary: Humans and other animals readily generalize abstract relations, such as recognizing constant in shape or color, whereas neural networks struggle. To investigate how neural networks generalize abstract relations, we introduce SimplifiedRPM, a novel benchmark for systematic evaluation. In parallel, we conduct human experiments to benchmark relational difficulty, enabling direct model-human comparisons. Testing four architectures--ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Wild Relation Network, and Scattering Compositional Learner (SCL)--we find that SCL best aligns with human behavior and generalizes best. Building on a geometric theory of neural representations, we show representational geometries that predict generalization. Layer-wise analysis reveals distinct relational reasoning strategies across models and suggests a trade-off where unseen rule representations compress into training-shaped subspaces. Guided by our geometric perspective, we propose and evaluate SNRloss, a novel objective balancing representation geometry. Our findings offer geometric insights into how neural networks generalize abstract relations, paving the way for more human-like visual reasoning in AI.

Model: Artificial Intelligence and Aesthetic Judgment
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12338v1.pdf
Summary: Generative AIs produce creative outputs in the style of human expression. We argue that encounters with the outputs of modern generative AI models are mediated by the same kinds of aesthetic judgments that organize our interactions with artwork. The interpretation procedure we use on art we find in museums is not an innate human faculty, but one developed over history by disciplines such as art history and art criticism to fulfill certain social functions. This gives us pause when considering our reactions to generative AI, how we should approach this new medium, and why generative AI seems to incite so much fear about the future. We naturally inherit a conundrum of causal inference from the history of art: a work can be read as a symptom of the cultural conditions that influenced its creation while simultaneously being framed as a timeless, seemingly acausal distillation of an eternal human condition. In this essay, we focus on an unresolved tension when we bring this dilemma to bear in the context of generative AI: are we looking for proof that generated media reflects something about the conditions that created it or some eternal human essence? Are current modes of interpretation sufficient for this task? Historically, new forms of art have changed how art is interpreted, with such influence used as evidence that a work of art has touched some essential human truth. As generative AI influences contemporary aesthetic judgment we outline some of the pitfalls and traps in attempting to scrutinize what AI generated media means.

Model: ActPC-Chem: Discrete Active Predictive Coding for Goal-Guided Algorithmic Chemistry as a Potential Cognitive Kernel for Hyperon & PRIMUS-Based AGI
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16547v1.pdf
Summary: We explore a novel paradigm (labeled ActPC-Chem) for biologically inspired, goal-guided artificial intelligence (AI) centered on a form of Discrete Active Predictive Coding (ActPC) operating within an algorithmic chemistry of rewrite rules. ActPC-Chem is envisioned as a foundational "cognitive kernel" for advanced cognitive architectures, such as the OpenCog Hyperon system, incorporating essential elements of the PRIMUS cognitive architecture. The central thesis is that general-intelligence-capable cognitive structures and dynamics can emerge in a system where both data and models are represented as evolving patterns of metagraph rewrite rules, and where prediction errors, intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, and semantic constraints guide the continual reorganization and refinement of these rules. Using a virtual "robot bug" thought experiment, we illustrate how such a system might self-organize to handle challenging tasks involving delayed and context-dependent rewards, integrating causal rule inference (AIRIS) and probabilistic logical abstraction (PLN) to discover and exploit conceptual patterns and causal constraints. Next, we describe how continuous predictive coding neural networks, which excel at handling noisy sensory data and motor control signals, can be coherently merged with the discrete ActPC substrate. Finally, we outline how these ideas might be extended to create a transformer-like architecture that foregoes traditional backpropagation in favor of rule-based transformations guided by ActPC. This layered architecture, supplemented with AIRIS and PLN, promises structured, multi-modal, and logically consistent next-token predictions and narrative sequences.
