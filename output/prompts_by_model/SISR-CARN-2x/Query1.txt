Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Enhancing Image Matting in Real-World Scenes with Mask-Guided Iterative Refinement
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17093v1.pdf
Summary: Real-world image matting is essential for applications in content creation and augmented reality. However, it remains challenging due to the complex nature of scenes and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce Mask2Alpha, an iterative refinement framework designed to enhance semantic comprehension, instance awareness, and fine-detail recovery in image matting. Our framework leverages self-supervised Vision Transformer features as semantic priors, strengthening contextual understanding in complex scenarios. To further improve instance differentiation, we implement a mask-guided feature selection module, enabling precise targeting of objects in multi-instance settings. Additionally, a sparse convolution-based optimization scheme allows Mask2Alpha to recover high-resolution details through progressive refinement,from low-resolution semantic passes to high-resolution sparse reconstructions. Benchmarking across various real-world datasets, Mask2Alpha consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its effectiveness in accurate and efficient image matting.

Model: On the Efficacy of Multi-scale Data Samplers for Vision Applications
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04502v1.pdf
Summary: Multi-scale resolution training has seen an increased adoption across multiple vision tasks, including classification and detection. Training with smaller resolutions enables faster training at the expense of a drop in accuracy. Conversely, training with larger resolutions has been shown to improve performance, but memory constraints often make this infeasible. In this paper, we empirically study the properties of multi-scale training procedures. We focus on variable batch size multi-scale data samplers that randomly sample an input resolution at each training iteration and dynamically adjust their batch size according to the resolution. Such samplers have been shown to improve model accuracy beyond standard training with a fixed batch size and resolution, though it is not clear why this is the case. We explore the properties of these data samplers by performing extensive experiments on ResNet-101 and validate our conclusions across multiple architectures, tasks, and datasets. We show that multi-scale samplers behave as implicit data regularizers and accelerate training speed. Compared to models trained with single-scale samplers, we show that models trained with multi-scale samplers retain or improve accuracy, while being better-calibrated and more robust to scaling and data distribution shifts. We additionally extend a multi-scale variable batch sampler with a simple curriculum that progressively grows resolutions throughout training, allowing for a compute reduction of more than 30%. We show that the benefits of multi-scale training extend to detection and instance segmentation tasks, where we observe a 37% reduction in training FLOPs along with a 3-4% mAP increase on MS-COCO using a Mask R-CNN model.
