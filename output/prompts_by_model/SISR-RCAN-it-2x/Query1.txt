Summary: Numerous industries have benefited from the use of machine learning and fashion in industry is no exception. By gaining a better understanding of what makes a good outfit, companies can provide useful product recommendations to their users. In this project, we follow two existing approaches that employ graphs to represent outfits and use modified versions of the Graph neural network (GNN) frameworks. Both Node-wise Graph Neural Network (NGNN) and Hypergraph Neural Network aim to score a set of items according to the outfit compatibility of items. The data used is the Polyvore Dataset which consists of curated outfits with product images and text descriptions for each product in an outfit. We recreate the analysis on a subset of this data and compare the two existing models on their performance on two tasks Fill in the blank (FITB): finding an item that completes an outfit, and Compatibility prediction: estimating compatibility of different items grouped as an outfit. We can replicate the results directionally and find that HGNN does have a slightly better performance on both tasks. On top of replicating the results of the two papers we also tried to use embeddings generated from a vision transformer and witness enhanced prediction accuracy across the board

Model: The Impact of Background Removal on Performance of Neural Networks for Fashion Image Classification and Segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09764v2.pdf
Summary: Fashion understanding is a hot topic in computer vision, with many applications having great business value in the market. Fashion understanding remains a difficult challenge for computer vision due to the immense diversity of garments and various scenes and backgrounds. In this work, we try removing the background from fashion images to boost data quality and increase model performance. Having fashion images of evident persons in fully visible garments, we can utilize Salient Object Detection to achieve the background removal of fashion data to our expectations. A fashion image with the background removed is claimed as the "rembg" image, contrasting with the original one in the fashion dataset. We conducted extensive comparative experiments with these two types of images on multiple aspects of model training, including model architectures, model initialization, compatibility with other training tricks and data augmentations, and target task types. Our experiments show that background removal can effectively work for fashion data in simple and shallow networks that are not susceptible to overfitting. It can improve model accuracy by up to 5% in the classification on the FashionStyle14 dataset when training models from scratch. However, background removal does not perform well in deep neural networks due to incompatibility with other regularization techniques like batch normalization, pre-trained initialization, and data augmentations introducing randomness. The loss of background pixels invalidates many existing training tricks in the model training, adding the risk of overfitting for deep models.

Model: FashionSAP: Symbols and Attributes Prompt for Fine-grained Fashion Vision-Language Pre-training

Summary: Fashion vision-language pre-training models have shown efficacy for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, general vision-language pre-training models pay less attention to fine-grained domain features, while these features are important in distinguishing the specific domain tasks from general tasks. We propose a method for fine-grained fashion vision-language pre-training based on fashion Symbols and Attributes Prompt (FashionSAP) to model fine-grained multi-modalities fashion attributes and characteristics. Firstly, we propose the fashion symbols, a novel abstract fashion concept layer, to represent different fashion items and to generalize various kinds of fine-grained fashion features, making modelling fine-grained attributes more effective. Secondly, the attributes prompt method is proposed to make the model learn specific attributes of fashion items explicitly. We design proper prompt templates according to the format of fashion data. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two public fashion benchmarks, i.e., FashionGen and FashionIQ, and FashionSAP gets SOTA performances for four popular fashion tasks. The ablation study also shows the proposed abstract fashion symbols, and the attribute prompt method enables the model to acquire fine-grained semantics in the fashion domain effectively. The obvious performance gains from FashionSAP provide a new baseline for future fashion task research.
