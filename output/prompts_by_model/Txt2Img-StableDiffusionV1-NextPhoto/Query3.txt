Model: A-BDD: Leveraging Data Augmentations for Safe Autonomous Driving in Adverse Weather and Lighting
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06071v2.pdf
Summary: High-autonomy vehicle functions rely on machine learning (ML) algorithms to understand the environment. Despite displaying remarkable performance in fair weather scenarios, perception algorithms are heavily affected by adverse weather and lighting conditions. To overcome these difficulties, ML engineers mainly rely on comprehensive real-world datasets. However, the difficulties in real-world data collection for critical areas of the operational design domain (ODD) often means synthetic data is required for perception training and safety validation. Thus, we present A-BDD, a large set of over 60,000 synthetically augmented images based on BDD100K that are equipped with semantic segmentation and bounding box annotations (inherited from the BDD100K dataset). The dataset contains augmented data for rain, fog, overcast and sunglare/shadow with varying intensity levels. We further introduce novel strategies utilizing feature-based image quality metrics like FID and CMMD, which help identify useful augmented and real-world data for ML training and testing. By conducting experiments on A-BDD, we provide evidence that data augmentations can play a pivotal role in closing performance gaps in adverse weather and lighting conditions.

Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06657v2.pdf

Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

Model: INPC: Implicit Neural Point Clouds for Radiance Field Rendering
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16862v1.pdf
Summary: We introduce a new approach for reconstruction and novel view synthesis of unbounded real-world scenes. In contrast to previous methods using either volumetric fields, grid-based models, or discrete point cloud proxies, we propose a hybrid scene representation, which implicitly encodes the geometry in a continuous octree-based probability field and view-dependent appearance in a multi-resolution hash grid. This allows for extraction of arbitrary explicit point clouds, which can be rendered using rasterization. In doing so, we combine the benefits of both worlds and retain favorable behavior during optimization: Our novel implicit point cloud representation and differentiable bilinear rasterizer enable fast rendering while preserving the fine geometric detail captured by volumetric neural fields. Furthermore, this representation does not depend on priors like structure-from-motion point clouds. Our method achieves state-of-the-art image quality on common benchmarks. Furthermore, we achieve fast inference at interactive frame rates, and can convert our trained model into a large, explicit point cloud to further enhance performance.
