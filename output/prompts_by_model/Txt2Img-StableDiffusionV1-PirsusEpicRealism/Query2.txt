Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06657v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/felixcheng97/agap
Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

Model: INPC: Implicit Neural Point Clouds for Radiance Field Rendering
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16862v1.pdf
Summary: We introduce a new approach for reconstruction and novel view synthesis of unbounded real-world scenes. In contrast to previous methods using either volumetric fields, grid-based models, or discrete point cloud proxies, we propose a hybrid scene representation, which implicitly encodes the geometry in a continuous octree-based probability field and view-dependent appearance in a multi-resolution hash grid. This allows for extraction of arbitrary explicit point clouds, which can be rendered using rasterization. In doing so, we combine the benefits of both worlds and retain favorable behavior during optimization: Our novel implicit point cloud representation and differentiable bilinear rasterizer enable fast rendering while preserving the fine geometric detail captured by volumetric neural fields. Furthermore, this representation does not depend on priors like structure-from-motion point clouds. Our method achieves state-of-the-art image quality on common benchmarks. Furthermore, we achieve fast inference at interactive frame rates, and can convert our trained model into a large, explicit point cloud to further enhance performance.

Model: Deep learning-based image exposure enhancement as a pre-processing for an accurate 3D colon surface reconstruction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03171v2.pdf
Summary: This contribution shows how an appropriate image pre-processing can improve a deep-learning based 3D reconstruction of colon parts. The assumption is that, rather than global image illumination corrections, local under- and over-exposures should be corrected in colonoscopy. An overview of the pipeline including the image exposure correction and a RNN-SLAM is first given. Then, this paper quantifies the reconstruction accuracy of the endoscope trajectory in the colon with and without appropriate illumination correction
