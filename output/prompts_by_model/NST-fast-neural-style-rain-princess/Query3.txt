Model: ARTxAI: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Curates Deep Representation Learning for Artistic Images using Fuzzy Techniques
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15284v1.pdf
Summary: Automatic art analysis employs different image processing techniques to classify and categorize works of art. When working with artistic images, we need to take into account further considerations compared to classical image processing. This is because such artistic paintings change drastically depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style. This can result in features that perform very well in a given task but do not grasp the whole of the visual and symbolic information contained in a painting. In this paper, we show how the features obtained from different tasks in artistic image classification are suitable to solve other ones of similar nature. We present different methods to improve the generalization capabilities and performance of artistic classification systems. Furthermore, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence method to map known visual traits of an image with the features used by the deep learning model considering fuzzy rules. These rules show the patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task and how effective is each of the patterns found. Our results show that our proposed context-aware features can achieve up to $6\%$ and $26\%$ more accurate results than other context- and non-context-aware solutions, respectively, depending on the specific task. We also show that some of the features used by these models can be more clearly correlated to visual traits in the original image than others.

Model: Harnessing Joint Rain-/Detail-aware Representations to Eliminate Intricate Rains

Summary: Recent advances in image deraining have focused on training powerful models on mixed multiple datasets comprising diverse rain types and backgrounds. However, this approach tends to overlook the inherent differences among rainy images, leading to suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we focus on addressing various rainy images by delving into meaningful representations that encapsulate both the rain and background components. Leveraging these representations as instructive guidance, we put forth a Context-based Instance-level Modulation (CoI-M) mechanism adept at efficiently modulating CNN- or Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we devise a rain-/detail-aware contrastive learning strategy to help extract joint rain-/detail-aware representations. By integrating CoI-M with the rain-/detail-aware Contrastive learning, we develop CoIC, an innovative and potent algorithm tailored for training models on mixed datasets. Moreover, CoIC offers insight into modeling relationships of datasets, quantitatively assessing the impact of rain and details on restoration, and unveiling distinct behaviors of models given diverse inputs. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of CoIC in boosting the deraining ability of CNN and Transformer models. CoIC also enhances the deraining prowess remarkably when real-world dataset is included.

Model: AdvRain: Adversarial Raindrops to Attack Camera-based Smart Vision Systems
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01338v2.pdf
Summary: Vision-based perception modules are increasingly deployed in many applications, especially autonomous vehicles and intelligent robots. These modules are being used to acquire information about the surroundings and identify obstacles. Hence, accurate detection and classification are essential to reach appropriate decisions and take appropriate and safe actions at all times. Current studies have demonstrated that "printed adversarial attacks", known as physical adversarial attacks, can successfully mislead perception models such as object detectors and image classifiers. However, most of these physical attacks are based on noticeable and eye-catching patterns for generated perturbations making them identifiable/detectable by human eye or in test drives. In this paper, we propose a camera-based inconspicuous adversarial attack (\textbf{AdvRain}) capable of fooling camera-based perception systems over all objects of the same class. Unlike mask based fake-weather attacks that require access to the underlying computing hardware or image memory, our attack is based on emulating the effects of a natural weather condition (i.e., Raindrops) that can be printed on a translucent sticker, which is externally placed over the lens of a camera. To accomplish this, we provide an iterative process based on performing a random search aiming to identify critical positions to make sure that the performed transformation is adversarial for a target classifier. Our transformation is based on blurring predefined parts of the captured image corresponding to the areas covered by the raindrop. We achieve a drop in average model accuracy of more than $45\%$ and $40\%$ on VGG19 for ImageNet and Resnet34 for Caltech-101, respectively, using only $20$ raindrops.
