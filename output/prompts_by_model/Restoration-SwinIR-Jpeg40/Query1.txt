Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06657v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/felixcheng97/agap
Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

Model: ImageNet-Hard: The Hardest Images Remaining from a Study of the Power of Zoom and Spatial Biases in Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05538v4.pdf
Summary: Image classifiers are information-discarding machines, by design. Yet, how these models discard information remains mysterious. We hypothesize that one way for image classifiers to reach high accuracy is to first zoom to the most discriminative region in the image and then extract features from there to predict image labels, discarding the rest of the image. Studying six popular networks ranging from AlexNet to CLIP, we find that proper framing of the input image can lead to the correct classification of 98.91% of ImageNet images. Furthermore, we uncover positional biases in various datasets, especially a strong center bias in two popular datasets: ImageNet-A and ObjectNet. Finally, leveraging our insights into the potential of zooming, we propose a test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions. Our method is more interpretable, accurate, and faster than MEMO, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTA method. We introduce ImageNet-Hard, a new benchmark that challenges SOTA classifiers including large vision-language models even when optimal zooming is allowed.

Model: Dissolving Is Amplifying: Towards Fine-Grained Anomaly Detection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14696v3.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/shijianjian/dia
Summary: Medical imaging often contains critical fine-grained features, such as tumors or hemorrhages, crucial for diagnosis yet potentially too subtle for detection with conventional methods. In this paper, we introduce \textit{DIA}, dissolving is amplifying. DIA is a fine-grained anomaly detection framework for medical images. First, we introduce \textit{dissolving transformations}. We employ diffusion with a generative diffusion model as a dedicated feature-aware denoiser. Applying diffusion to medical images in a certain manner can remove or diminish fine-grained discriminative features. Second, we introduce an \textit{amplifying framework} based on contrastive learning to learn a semantically meaningful representation of medical images in a self-supervised manner, with a focus on fine-grained features. The amplifying framework contrasts additional pairs of images with and without dissolving transformations applied and thereby emphasizes the dissolved fine-grained features. DIA significantly improves the medical anomaly detection performance with around 18.40\% AUC boost against the baseline method and achieves an overall SOTA against other benchmark methods.
