Summary: This work presents a progressive image vectorization technique that reconstructs the raster image as layer-wise vectors from semantic-aligned macro structures to finer details. Our approach introduces a new image simplification method leveraging the feature-average effect in the Score Distillation Sampling mechanism, achieving effective visual abstraction from the detailed to coarse. Guided by the sequence of progressive simplified images, we propose a two-stage vectorization process of structural buildup and visual refinement, constructing the vectors in an organized and manageable manner. The resulting vectors are layered and well-aligned with the target image's explicit and implicit semantic structures. Our method demonstrates high performance across a wide range of images. Comparative analysis with existing vectorization methods highlights our technique's superiority in creating vectors with high visual fidelity, and more importantly, achieving higher semantic alignment and more compact layered representation.

Model: Image Triangulation Using the Sobel Operator for Vertex Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16112v1.pdf
Summary: Image triangulation, the practice of decomposing images into triangles, deliberately employs simplification to create an abstracted representation. While triangulating an image is a relatively simple process, difficulties arise when determining which vertices produce recognizable and visually pleasing output images. With the goal of producing art, we discuss an image triangulation algorithm in Python that utilizes Sobel edge detection and point cloud sparsification to determine final vertices for a triangulation, resulting in the creation of artistic triangulated compositions.

Model: Polygonizer: An auto-regressive building delineator
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04048v1.pdf
Summary: In geospatial planning, it is often essential to represent objects in a vectorized format, as this format easily translates to downstream tasks such as web development, graphics, or design. While these problems are frequently addressed using semantic segmentation, which requires additional post-processing to vectorize objects in a non-trivial way, we present an Image-to-Sequence model that allows for direct shape inference and is ready for vector-based workflows out of the box. We demonstrate the model's performance in various ways, including perturbations to the image input that correspond to variations or artifacts commonly encountered in remote sensing applications. Our model outperforms prior works when using ground truth bounding boxes (one object per image), achieving the lowest maximum tangent angle error.
