You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"When working on a poster design, I used this to simplify a photo into editable parts—each color and region became a separate layer. What kind of model makes that possible?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Summary: In geospatial planning, it is often essential to represent objects in a vectorized format, as this format easily translates to downstream tasks such as web development, graphics, or design. While these problems are frequently addressed using semantic segmentation, which requires additional post-processing to vectorize objects in a non-trivial way, we present an Image-to-Sequence model that allows for direct shape inference and is ready for vector-based workflows out of the box. We demonstrate the model's performance in various ways, including perturbations to the image input that correspond to variations or artifacts commonly encountered in remote sensing applications. Our model outperforms prior works when using ground truth bounding boxes (one object per image), achieving the lowest maximum tangent angle error.

Model: HyperDreamer: Hyper-Realistic 3D Content Generation and Editing from a Single Image
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04543v1.pdf
Summary: 3D content creation from a single image is a long-standing yet highly desirable task. Recent advances introduce 2D diffusion priors, yielding reasonable results. However, existing methods are not hyper-realistic enough for post-generation usage, as users cannot view, render and edit the resulting 3D content from a full range. To address these challenges, we introduce HyperDreamer with several key designs and appealing properties: 1) Viewable: 360 degree mesh modeling with high-resolution textures enables the creation of visually compelling 3D models from a full range of observation points. 2) Renderable: Fine-grained semantic segmentation and data-driven priors are incorporated as guidance to learn reasonable albedo, roughness, and specular properties of the materials, enabling semantic-aware arbitrary material estimation. 3) Editable: For a generated model or their own data, users can interactively select any region via a few clicks and efficiently edit the texture with text-based guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HyperDreamer in modeling region-aware materials with high-resolution textures and enabling user-friendly editing. We believe that HyperDreamer holds promise for advancing 3D content creation and finding applications in various domains.

Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06657v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/felixcheng97/agap
Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.
