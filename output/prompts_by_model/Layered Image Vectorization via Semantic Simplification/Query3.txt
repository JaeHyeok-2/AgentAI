Model: Layered Image Vectorization via Semantic Simplification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05404v1.pdf
Summary: This work presents a progressive image vectorization technique that reconstructs the raster image as layer-wise vectors from semantic-aligned macro structures to finer details. Our approach introduces a new image simplification method leveraging the feature-average effect in the Score Distillation Sampling mechanism, achieving effective visual abstraction from the detailed to coarse. Guided by the sequence of progressive simplified images, we propose a two-stage vectorization process of structural buildup and visual refinement, constructing the vectors in an organized and manageable manner. The resulting vectors are layered and well-aligned with the target image's explicit and implicit semantic structures. Our method demonstrates high performance across a wide range of images. Comparative analysis with existing vectorization methods highlights our technique's superiority in creating vectors with high visual fidelity, and more importantly, achieving higher semantic alignment and more compact layered representation.

Model: The Simpler The Better: An Entropy-Based Importance Metric To Reduce Neural Networks' Depth
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18949v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/vgcq/easier
Summary: While deep neural networks are highly effective at solving complex tasks, large pre-trained models are commonly employed even to solve consistently simpler downstream tasks, which do not necessarily require a large model's complexity. Motivated by the awareness of the ever-growing AI environmental impact, we propose an efficiency strategy that leverages prior knowledge transferred by large models. Simple but effective, we propose a method relying on an Entropy-bASed Importance mEtRic (EASIER) to reduce the depth of over-parametrized deep neural networks, which alleviates their computational burden. We assess the effectiveness of our method on traditional image classification setups. Our code is available at https://github.com/VGCQ/EASIER.

Model: Leveraging Perceptual Scores for Dataset Pruning in Computer Vision Tasks
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07243v1.pdf
Summary: In this paper we propose a score of an image to use for coreset selection in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. The score is the entropy of an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version. Thus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or training. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are stored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is that most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More importantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an image. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher entropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to biased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep learning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that increases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this simple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.
