Summary: Low-light image enhancement is an important task in computer vision, essential for improving the visibility and quality of images captured in non-optimal lighting conditions. Inadequate illumination can lead to significant information loss and poor image quality, impacting various applications such as surveillance. photography, or even autonomous driving. In this regard, automated methods have been developed to automatically adjust illumination in the image for a better visual perception. Current enhancement techniques often use specific datasets to enhance low-light images, but still present challenges when adapting to diverse real-world conditions, where illumination degradation may be localized to specific regions. To address this challenge, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, whose main approach is the use of a classification mechanism to determine whether local or global illumination enhancement is required. Subsequently, estimator networks adjust illumination based on this classification and simultaneously enhance color fidelity. ALEN integrates the Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization, complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet), and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise estimation of illumination and color, respectively. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for low-light conditions were carried out to underscore ALEN's robust generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The ALEN not only enhances image quality in terms of visual perception but also represents an advancement in high-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, as presented in this work.

Model: LIME-Eval: Rethinking Low-light Image Enhancement Evaluation via Object Detection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08810v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/lime-j/lime-eval
Summary: Due to the nature of enhancement--the absence of paired ground-truth information, high-level vision tasks have been recently employed to evaluate the performance of low-light image enhancement. A widely-used manner is to see how accurately an object detector trained on enhanced low-light images by different candidates can perform with respect to annotated semantic labels. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the mentioned approach is generally prone to overfitting, and thus diminishes its measurement reliability. In search of a proper evaluation metric, we propose LIME-Bench, the first online benchmark platform designed to collect human preferences for low-light enhancement, providing a valuable dataset for validating the correlation between human perception and automated evaluation metrics. We then customize LIME-Eval, a novel evaluation framework that utilizes detectors pre-trained on standard-lighting datasets without object annotations, to judge the quality of enhanced images. By adopting an energy-based strategy to assess the accuracy of output confidence maps, our LIME-Eval can simultaneously bypass biases associated with retraining detectors and circumvent the reliance on annotations for dim images. Comprehensive experiments are provided to reveal the effectiveness of our LIME-Eval. Our benchmark platform (https://huggingface.co/spaces/lime-j/eval) and code (https://github.com/lime-j/lime-eval) are available online.

Model: FeatEnHancer: Enhancing Hierarchical Features for Object Detection and Beyond Under Low-Light Vision
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03594v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/khurramHashmi/FeatEnHancer
Summary: Extracting useful visual cues for the downstream tasks is especially challenging under low-light vision. Prior works create enhanced representations by either correlating visual quality with machine perception or designing illumination-degrading transformation methods that require pre-training on synthetic datasets. We argue that optimizing enhanced image representation pertaining to the loss of the downstream task can result in more expressive representations. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel module, FeatEnHancer, that hierarchically combines multiscale features using multiheaded attention guided by task-related loss function to create suitable representations. Furthermore, our intra-scale enhancement improves the quality of features extracted at each scale or level, as well as combines features from different scales in a way that reflects their relative importance for the task at hand. FeatEnHancer is a general-purpose plug-and-play module and can be incorporated into any low-light vision pipeline. We show with extensive experimentation that the enhanced representation produced with FeatEnHancer significantly and consistently improves results in several low-light vision tasks, including dark object detection (+5.7 mAP on ExDark), face detection (+1.5 mAPon DARK FACE), nighttime semantic segmentation (+5.1 mIoU on ACDC ), and video object detection (+1.8 mAP on DarkVision), highlighting the effectiveness of enhancing hierarchical features under low-light vision.
