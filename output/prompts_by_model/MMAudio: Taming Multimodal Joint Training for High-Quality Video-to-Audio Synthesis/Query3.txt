Model: Tri-Ergon: Fine-grained Video-to-Audio Generation with Multi-modal Conditions and LUFS Control
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20378v1.pdf
Summary: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation utilizes visual-only video features to produce realistic sounds that correspond to the scene. However, current V2A models often lack fine-grained control over the generated audio, especially in terms of loudness variation and the incorporation of multi-modal conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Tri-Ergon, a diffusion-based V2A model that incorporates textual, auditory, and pixel-level visual prompts to enable detailed and semantically rich audio synthesis. Additionally, we introduce Loudness Units relative to Full Scale (LUFS) embedding, which allows for precise manual control of the loudness changes over time for individual audio channels, enabling our model to effectively address the intricate correlation of video and audio in real-world Foley workflows. Tri-Ergon is capable of creating 44.1 kHz high-fidelity stereo audio clips of varying lengths up to 60 seconds, which significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art V2A methods that typically generate mono audio for a fixed duration.

Model: Learning Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Representations for Sound Recommendations
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07406v1.pdf
Summary: We propose a novel self-supervised approach for learning audio and visual representations from unlabeled videos, based on their correspondence. The approach uses an attention mechanism to learn the relative importance of convolutional features extracted at different resolutions from the audio and visual streams and uses the attention features to encode the audio and visual input based on their correspondence. We evaluated the representations learned by the model to classify audio-visual correlation as well as to recommend sound effects for visual scenes. Our results show that the representations generated by the attention model improves the correlation accuracy compared to the baseline, by 18% and the recommendation accuracy by 10% for VGG-Sound, which is a public video dataset. Additionally, audio-visual representations learned by training the attention model with cross-modal contrastive learning further improves the recommendation performance, based on our evaluation using VGG-Sound and a more challenging dataset consisting of gameplay video recordings.

Model: Bridging High-Quality Audio and Video via Language for Sound Effects Retrieval from Visual Queries
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09089v1.pdf
Summary: Finding the right sound effects (SFX) to match moments in a video is a difficult and time-consuming task, and relies heavily on the quality and completeness of text metadata. Retrieving high-quality (HQ) SFX using a video frame directly as the query is an attractive alternative, removing the reliance on text metadata and providing a low barrier to entry for non-experts. Due to the lack of HQ audio-visual training data, previous work on audio-visual retrieval relies on YouTube (in-the-wild) videos of varied quality for training, where the audio is often noisy and the video of amateur quality. As such it is unclear whether these systems would generalize to the task of matching HQ audio to production-quality video. To address this, we propose a multimodal framework for recommending HQ SFX given a video frame by (1) leveraging large language models and foundational vision-language models to bridge HQ audio and video to create audio-visual pairs, resulting in a highly scalable automatic audio-visual data curation pipeline; and (2) using pre-trained audio and visual encoders to train a contrastive learning-based retrieval system. We show that our system, trained using our automatic data curation pipeline, significantly outperforms baselines trained on in-the-wild data on the task of HQ SFX retrieval for video. Furthermore, while the baselines fail to generalize to this task, our system generalizes well from clean to in-the-wild data, outperforming the baselines on a dataset of YouTube videos despite only being trained on the HQ audio-visual pairs. A user study confirms that people prefer SFX retrieved by our system over the baseline 67% of the time both for HQ and in-the-wild data. Finally, we present ablations to determine the impact of model and data pipeline design choices on downstream retrieval performance.
