Model: Tri-Ergon: Fine-grained Video-to-Audio Generation with Multi-modal Conditions and LUFS Control
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20378v1.pdf
Summary: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation utilizes visual-only video features to produce realistic sounds that correspond to the scene. However, current V2A models often lack fine-grained control over the generated audio, especially in terms of loudness variation and the incorporation of multi-modal conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Tri-Ergon, a diffusion-based V2A model that incorporates textual, auditory, and pixel-level visual prompts to enable detailed and semantically rich audio synthesis. Additionally, we introduce Loudness Units relative to Full Scale (LUFS) embedding, which allows for precise manual control of the loudness changes over time for individual audio channels, enabling our model to effectively address the intricate correlation of video and audio in real-world Foley workflows. Tri-Ergon is capable of creating 44.1 kHz high-fidelity stereo audio clips of varying lengths up to 60 seconds, which significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art V2A methods that typically generate mono audio for a fixed duration.

Model: Bridging High-Quality Audio and Video via Language for Sound Effects Retrieval from Visual Queries
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09089v1.pdf
Summary: Finding the right sound effects (SFX) to match moments in a video is a difficult and time-consuming task, and relies heavily on the quality and completeness of text metadata. Retrieving high-quality (HQ) SFX using a video frame directly as the query is an attractive alternative, removing the reliance on text metadata and providing a low barrier to entry for non-experts. Due to the lack of HQ audio-visual training data, previous work on audio-visual retrieval relies on YouTube (in-the-wild) videos of varied quality for training, where the audio is often noisy and the video of amateur quality. As such it is unclear whether these systems would generalize to the task of matching HQ audio to production-quality video. To address this, we propose a multimodal framework for recommending HQ SFX given a video frame by (1) leveraging large language models and foundational vision-language models to bridge HQ audio and video to create audio-visual pairs, resulting in a highly scalable automatic audio-visual data curation pipeline; and (2) using pre-trained audio and visual encoders to train a contrastive learning-based retrieval system. We show that our system, trained using our automatic data curation pipeline, significantly outperforms baselines trained on in-the-wild data on the task of HQ SFX retrieval for video. Furthermore, while the baselines fail to generalize to this task, our system generalizes well from clean to in-the-wild data, outperforming the baselines on a dataset of YouTube videos despite only being trained on the HQ audio-visual pairs. A user study confirms that people prefer SFX retrieved by our system over the baseline 67% of the time both for HQ and in-the-wild data. Finally, we present ablations to determine the impact of model and data pipeline design choices on downstream retrieval performance.

Model: Vocalics in Human-Drone Interaction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17668v1.pdf
Summary: As the presence of flying robots continues to grow in both commercial and private sectors, it necessitates an understanding of appropriate methods for nonverbal interaction with humans. While visual cues, such as gestures incorporated into trajectories, are more apparent and thoroughly researched, acoustic cues have remained unexplored, despite their potential to enhance human-drone interaction. Given that additional audiovisual and sensory equipment is not always desired or practicable, and flight noise often masks potential acoustic communication in rotary-wing drones, such as through a loudspeaker, the rotors themselves offer potential for nonverbal communication. In this paper, quadrotor trajectories are augmented by acoustic information that does not visually affect the flight, but adds audible information that significantly facilitates distinctiveness. A user study (N=192) demonstrates that sonically augmenting the trajectories of two aerial gestures makes them more easily distinguishable. This enhancement contributes to human-drone interaction through onboard means, particularly in situations where the human cannot see or look at the drone.
