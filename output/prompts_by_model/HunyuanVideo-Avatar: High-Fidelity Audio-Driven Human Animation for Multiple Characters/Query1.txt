Model: StyleLipSync: Style-based Personalized Lip-sync Video Generation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00521v2.pdf
Summary: In this paper, we present StyleLipSync, a style-based personalized lip-sync video generative model that can generate identity-agnostic lip-synchronizing video from arbitrary audio. To generate a video of arbitrary identities, we leverage expressive lip prior from the semantically rich latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN, where we can also design a video consistency with a linear transformation. In contrast to the previous lip-sync methods, we introduce pose-aware masking that dynamically locates the mask to improve the naturalness over frames by utilizing a 3D parametric mesh predictor frame by frame. Moreover, we propose a few-shot lip-sync adaptation method for an arbitrary person by introducing a sync regularizer that preserves lip-sync generalization while enhancing the person-specific visual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can generate accurate lip-sync videos even with the zero-shot setting and enhance characteristics of an unseen face using a few seconds of target video through the proposed adaptation method.

Model: EmoDubber: Towards High Quality and Emotion Controllable Movie Dubbing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08988v2.pdf
Summary: Given a piece of text, a video clip, and a reference audio, the movie dubbing task aims to generate speech that aligns with the video while cloning the desired voice. The existing methods have two primary deficiencies: (1) They struggle to simultaneously hold audio-visual sync and achieve clear pronunciation; (2) They lack the capacity to express user-defined emotions. To address these problems, we propose EmoDubber, an emotion-controllable dubbing architecture that allows users to specify emotion type and emotional intensity while satisfying high-quality lip sync and pronunciation. Specifically, we first design Lip-related Prosody Aligning (LPA), which focuses on learning the inherent consistency between lip motion and prosody variation by duration level contrastive learning to incorporate reasonable alignment. Then, we design Pronunciation Enhancing (PE) strategy to fuse the video-level phoneme sequences by efficient conformer to improve speech intelligibility. Next, the speaker identity adapting module aims to decode acoustics prior and inject the speaker style embedding. After that, the proposed Flow-based User Emotion Controlling (FUEC) is used to synthesize waveform by flow matching prediction network conditioned on acoustics prior. In this process, the FUEC determines the gradient direction and guidance scale based on the user's emotion instructions by the positive and negative guidance mechanism, which focuses on amplifying the desired emotion while suppressing others. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate favorable performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

Model: Dimitra: Audio-driven Diffusion model for Expressive Talking Head Generation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17198v1.pdf
Summary: We propose Dimitra, a novel framework for audio-driven talking head generation, streamlined to learn lip motion, facial expression, as well as head pose motion. Specifically, we train a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer (cMDT) by modeling facial motion sequences with 3D representation. We condition the cMDT with only two input signals, an audio-sequence, as well as a reference facial image. By extracting additional features directly from audio, Dimitra is able to increase quality and realism of generated videos. In particular, phoneme sequences contribute to the realism of lip motion, whereas text transcript to facial expression and head pose realism. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on two widely employed datasets, VoxCeleb2 and HDTF, showcase that Dimitra is able to outperform existing approaches for generating realistic talking heads imparting lip motion, facial expression, and head pose.
