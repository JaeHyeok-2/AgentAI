You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I gave it voices for two characters, and it made both of them move and interact like in a real conversation. How does it handle multiple people that well?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Hi Sheldon! Creating Deep Personalized Characters from TV Shows
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.11093v1.pdf
Summary: Imagine an interesting multimodal interactive scenario that you can see, hear, and chat with an AI-generated digital character, who is capable of behaving like Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory, as a DEEP copy from appearance to personality. Towards this fantastic multimodal chatting scenario, we propose a novel task, named Deep Personalized Character Creation (DPCC): creating multimodal chat personalized characters from multimodal data such as TV shows. Specifically, given a single- or multi-modality input (text, audio, video), the goal of DPCC is to generate a multi-modality (text, audio, video) response, which should be well-matched the personality of a specific character such as Sheldon, and of high quality as well. To support this novel task, we further collect a character centric multimodal dialogue dataset, named Deep Personalized Character Dataset (DPCD), from TV shows. DPCD contains character-specific multimodal dialogue data of ~10k utterances and ~6 hours of audio/video per character, which is around 10 times larger compared to existing related datasets.On DPCD, we present a baseline method for the DPCC task and create 5 Deep personalized digital Characters (DeepCharacters) from Big Bang TV Shows. We conduct both subjective and objective experiments to evaluate the multimodal response from DeepCharacters in terms of characterization and quality. The results demonstrates that, on our collected DPCD dataset, the proposed baseline can create personalized digital characters for generating multimodal response.Our collected DPCD dataset, the code of data collection and our baseline will be published soon.

Model: FurChat: An Embodied Conversational Agent using LLMs, Combining Open and Closed-Domain Dialogue with Facial Expressions
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15214v2.pdf
Summary: We demonstrate an embodied conversational agent that can function as a receptionist and generate a mixture of open and closed-domain dialogue along with facial expressions, by using a large language model (LLM) to develop an engaging conversation. We deployed the system onto a Furhat robot, which is highly expressive and capable of using both verbal and nonverbal cues during interaction. The system was designed specifically for the National Robotarium to interact with visitors through natural conversations, providing them with information about the facilities, research, news, upcoming events, etc. The system utilises the state-of-the-art GPT-3.5 model to generate such information along with domain-general conversations and facial expressions based on prompt engineering.

Model: A Multitask, Multilingual, Multimodal Evaluation of ChatGPT on Reasoning, Hallucination, and Interactivity
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04023v4.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/hltchkust/chatgpt-evaluation
Summary: This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating interactive LLMs such as ChatGPT using publicly available data sets. We carry out an extensive technical evaluation of ChatGPT using 23 data sets covering 8 different common NLP application tasks. We evaluate the multitask, multilingual and multi-modal aspects of ChatGPT based on these data sets and a newly designed multimodal dataset. We find that ChatGPT outperforms LLMs with zero-shot learning on most tasks and even outperforms fine-tuned models on some tasks. We find that it is better at understanding non-Latin script languages than generating them. It is able to generate multimodal content from textual prompts, via an intermediate code generation step. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT is 63.41% accurate on average in 10 different reasoning categories under logical reasoning, non-textual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, hence making it an unreliable reasoner. It is, for example, better at deductive than inductive reasoning. ChatGPT suffers from hallucination problems like other LLMs and it generates more extrinsic hallucinations from its parametric memory as it does not have access to an external knowledge base. Finally, the interactive feature of ChatGPT enables human collaboration with the underlying LLM to improve its performance, i.e, 8% ROUGE-1 on summarization and 2% ChrF++ on machine translation, in a multi-turn "prompt engineering" fashion. We also release codebase for evaluation set extraction.
