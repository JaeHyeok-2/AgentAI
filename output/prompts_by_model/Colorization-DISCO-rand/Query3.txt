Model: Control Color: Multimodal Diffusion-based Interactive Image Colorization
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10855v1.pdf
Summary: Despite the existence of numerous colorization methods, several limitations still exist, such as lack of user interaction, inflexibility in local colorization, unnatural color rendering, insufficient color variation, and color overflow. To solve these issues, we introduce Control Color (CtrlColor), a multi-modal colorization method that leverages the pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model, offering promising capabilities in highly controllable interactive image colorization. While several diffusion-based methods have been proposed, supporting colorization in multiple modalities remains non-trivial. In this study, we aim to tackle both unconditional and conditional image colorization (text prompts, strokes, exemplars) and address color overflow and incorrect color within a unified framework. Specifically, we present an effective way to encode user strokes to enable precise local color manipulation and employ a practical way to constrain the color distribution similar to exemplars. Apart from accepting text prompts as conditions, these designs add versatility to our approach. We also introduce a novel module based on self-attention and a content-guided deformable autoencoder to address the long-standing issues of color overflow and inaccurate coloring. Extensive comparisons show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art image colorization methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Model: DreamColour: Controllable Video Colour Editing without Training
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05180v1.pdf
Summary: Video colour editing is a crucial task for content creation, yet existing solutions either require painstaking frame-by-frame manipulation or produce unrealistic results with temporal artefacts. We present a practical, training-free framework that makes precise video colour editing accessible through an intuitive interface while maintaining professional-quality output. Our key insight is that by decoupling spatial and temporal aspects of colour editing, we can better align with users' natural workflow -- allowing them to focus on precise colour selection in key frames before automatically propagating changes across time. We achieve this through a novel technical framework that combines: (i) a simple point-and-click interface merging grid-based colour selection with automatic instance segmentation for precise spatial control, (ii) bidirectional colour propagation that leverages inherent video motion patterns, and (iii) motion-aware blending that ensures smooth transitions even with complex object movements. Through extensive evaluation on diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods while eliminating the need for training or specialized hardware, making professional-quality video colour editing accessible to everyone.

Model: RecolorCloud: A Point Cloud Tool for Recoloring, Segmentation, and Conversion
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12470v1.pdf
Summary: Point clouds are a 3D space representation of an environment that was recorded with a high precision laser scanner. These scanners can suffer from environmental interference such as surface shading, texturing, and reflections. Because of this, point clouds may be contaminated with fake or incorrect colors. Current open source or proprietary tools offer limited or no access to correcting these visual errors automatically.   RecolorCloud is a tool developed to resolve these color conflicts by utilizing automated color recoloring. We offer the ability to deleting or recoloring outlier points automatically with users only needing to specify bounding box regions to effect colors. Results show a vast improvement of the photo-realistic quality of large point clouds. Additionally, users can quickly recolor a point cloud with set semantic segmentation colors.
