Summary: Object detection and segmentation are two core modules of an autonomous vehicle perception system. They should have high efficiency and low latency while reducing computational complexity. Currently, the most commonly used algorithms are based on deep neural networks, which guarantee high efficiency but require high-performance computing platforms. In the case of autonomous vehicles, i.e. cars, but also drones, it is necessary to use embedded platforms with limited computing power, which makes it difficult to meet the requirements described above. A reduction in the complexity of the network can be achieved by using an appropriate: architecture, representation (reduced numerical precision, quantisation, pruning), and computing platform. In this paper, we focus on the first factor - the use of so-called detection-segmentation networks as a component of a perception system. We considered the task of segmenting the drivable area and road markings in combination with the detection of selected objects (pedestrians, traffic lights, and obstacles). We compared the performance of three different architectures described in the literature: MultiTask V3, HybridNets, and YOLOP. We conducted the experiments on a custom dataset consisting of approximately 500 images of the drivable area and lane markings, and 250 images of detected objects. Of the three methods analysed, MultiTask V3 proved to be the best, achieving 99% mAP_50 for detection, 97% MIoU for drivable area segmentation, and 91% MIoU for lane segmentation, as well as 124 fps on the RTX 3060 graphics card. This architecture is a good solution for embedded perception systems for autonomous vehicles. The code is available at: https://github.com/vision-agh/MMAR_2023.

Summary: An in-depth exploration of object detection and semantic segmentation is provided, combining theoretical foundations with practical applications. State-of-the-art advancements in machine learning and deep learning are reviewed, focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), YOLO architectures, and transformer-based approaches such as DETR. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and large language models for enhancing object detection in complex environments is examined. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of big data processing is presented, with emphasis on model optimization and performance evaluation metrics. By bridging the gap between traditional methods and modern deep learning frameworks, valuable insights are offered for researchers, data scientists, and engineers aiming to apply AI-driven methodologies to large-scale object detection tasks.

Model: Sharp Eyes: A Salient Object Detector Working The Same Way as Human Visual Characteristics
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07431v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/lesonly/senet
Summary: Current methods aggregate multi-level features or introduce edge and skeleton to get more refined saliency maps. However, little attention is paid to how to obtain the complete salient object in cluttered background, where the targets are usually similar in color and texture to the background. To handle this complex scene, we propose a sharp eyes network (SENet) that first seperates the object from scene, and then finely segments it, which is in line with human visual characteristics, i.e., to look first and then focus. Different from previous methods which directly integrate edge or skeleton to supplement the defects of objects, the proposed method aims to utilize the expanded objects to guide the network obtain complete prediction. Specifically, SENet mainly consists of target separation (TS) brach and object segmentation (OS) branch trained by minimizing a new hierarchical difference aware (HDA) loss. In the TS branch, we construct a fractal structure to produce saliency features with expanded boundary via the supervision of expanded ground truth, which can enlarge the detail difference between foreground and background. In the OS branch, we first aggregate multi-level features to adaptively select complementary components, and then feed the saliency features with expanded boundary into aggregated features to guide the network obtain complete prediction. Moreover, we propose the HDA loss to further improve the structural integrity and local details of the salient objects, which assigns weight to each pixel according to its distance from the boundary hierarchically. Hard pixels with similar appearance in border region will be given more attention hierarchically to emphasize their importance in completeness prediction. Comprehensive experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.
