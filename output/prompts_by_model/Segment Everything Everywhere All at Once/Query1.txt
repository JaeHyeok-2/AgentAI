Summary: Semantic segmentation is a core task in computer vision. Existing methods are generally divided into two categories: automatic and interactive. Interactive approaches, exemplified by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have shown promise as pre-trained models. However, current adaptation strategies for these models tend to lean towards either automatic or interactive approaches. Interactive methods depend on prompts user input to operate, while automatic ones bypass the interactive promptability entirely. Addressing these limitations, we introduce a novel paradigm and its first model: the Automatic and Interactive Segment Anything Model (AI-SAM). In this paradigm, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of prompt quality and introduce the pioneering Automatic and Interactive Prompter (AI-Prompter) that automatically generates initial point prompts while accepting additional user inputs. Our experimental results demonstrate AI-SAM's effectiveness in the automatic setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Significantly, it offers the flexibility to incorporate additional user prompts, thereby further enhancing its performance. The project page is available at https://github.com/ymp5078/AI-SAM.

Model: RSPrompter: Learning to Prompt for Remote Sensing Instance Segmentation based on Visual Foundation Model
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.16269v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/KyanChen/RSPrompter
Summary: Leveraging the extensive training data from SA-1B, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates remarkable generalization and zero-shot capabilities. However, as a category-agnostic instance segmentation method, SAM heavily relies on prior manual guidance, including points, boxes, and coarse-grained masks. Furthermore, its performance in remote sensing image segmentation tasks remains largely unexplored and unproven. In this paper, we aim to develop an automated instance segmentation approach for remote sensing images, based on the foundational SAM model and incorporating semantic category information. Drawing inspiration from prompt learning, we propose a method to learn the generation of appropriate prompts for SAM. This enables SAM to produce semantically discernible segmentation results for remote sensing images, a concept we have termed RSPrompter. We also propose several ongoing derivatives for instance segmentation tasks, drawing on recent advancements within the SAM community, and compare their performance with RSPrompter. Extensive experimental results, derived from the WHU building, NWPU VHR-10, and SSDD datasets, validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code for our method is publicly available at kychen.me/RSPrompter.

Model: Segment Any Cell: A SAM-based Auto-prompting Fine-tuning Framework for Nuclei Segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13220v1.pdf
Summary: In the rapidly evolving field of AI research, foundational models like BERT and GPT have significantly advanced language and vision tasks. The advent of pretrain-prompting models such as ChatGPT and Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) has further revolutionized image segmentation. However, their applications in specialized areas, particularly in nuclei segmentation within medical imaging, reveal a key challenge: the generation of high-quality, informative prompts is as crucial as applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) fine-tuning techniques on foundation models. To address this, we introduce Segment Any Cell (SAC), an innovative framework that enhances SAM specifically for nuclei segmentation. SAC integrates a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) within the attention layer of the Transformer to improve the fine-tuning process, outperforming existing SOTA methods. It also introduces an innovative auto-prompt generator that produces effective prompts to guide segmentation, a critical factor in handling the complexities of nuclei segmentation in biomedical imaging. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SAC in nuclei segmentation tasks, proving its effectiveness as a tool for pathologists and researchers. Our contributions include a novel prompt generation strategy, automated adaptability for diverse segmentation tasks, the innovative application of Low-Rank Attention Adaptation in SAM, and a versatile framework for semantic segmentation challenges.
