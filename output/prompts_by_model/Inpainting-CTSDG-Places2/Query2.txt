Model: Adversarial Manhole: Challenging Monocular Depth Estimation and Semantic Segmentation Models with Patch Attack
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14879v1.pdf

Summary: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) and semantic segmentation (SS) are crucial for the navigation and environmental interpretation of many autonomous driving systems. However, their vulnerability to practical adversarial attacks is a significant concern. This paper presents a novel adversarial attack using practical patches that mimic manhole covers to deceive MDE and SS models. The goal is to cause these systems to misinterpret scenes, leading to false detections of near obstacles or non-passable objects. We use Depth Planar Mapping to precisely position these patches on road surfaces, enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Our experiments show that these adversarial patches cause a 43% relative error in MDE and achieve a 96% attack success rate in SS. These patches create affected error regions over twice their size in MDE and approximately equal to their size in SS. Our studies also confirm the patch's effectiveness in physical simulations, the adaptability of the patches across different target models, and the effectiveness of our proposed modules, highlighting their practical implications.

Model: VET: Visual Error Tomography for Point Cloud Completion and High-Quality Neural Rendering
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04634v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/lfranke/vet
Summary: In the last few years, deep neural networks opened the doors for big advances in novel view synthesis. Many of these approaches are based on a (coarse) proxy geometry obtained by structure from motion algorithms. Small deficiencies in this proxy can be fixed by neural rendering, but larger holes or missing parts, as they commonly appear for thin structures or for glossy regions, still lead to distracting artifacts and temporal instability. In this paper, we present a novel neural-rendering-based approach to detect and fix such deficiencies. As a proxy, we use a point cloud, which allows us to easily remove outlier geometry and to fill in missing geometry without complicated topological operations. Keys to our approach are (i) a differentiable, blending point-based renderer that can blend out redundant points, as well as (ii) the concept of Visual Error Tomography (VET), which allows us to lift 2D error maps to identify 3D-regions lacking geometry and to spawn novel points accordingly. Furthermore, (iii) by adding points as nested environment maps, our approach allows us to generate high-quality renderings of the surroundings in the same pipeline. In our results, we show that our approach can improve the quality of a point cloud obtained by structure from motion and thus increase novel view synthesis quality significantly. In contrast to point growing techniques, the approach can also fix large-scale holes and missing thin structures effectively. Rendering quality outperforms state-of-the-art methods and temporal stability is significantly improved, while rendering is possible at real-time frame rates.

Model: Looking Around Corners: Generative Methods in Terrain Extension
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07160v1.pdf
Summary: In this paper, we provide an early look at our model for generating terrain that is occluded in the initial lidar scan or out of range of the sensor. As a proof of concept, we show that a transformer based framework is able to be overfit to predict the geometries of unobserved roads around intersections or corners. We discuss our method for generating training data, as well as a unique loss function for training our terrain extension network. The framework is tested on data from the SemanticKitti [1] dataset. Unlabeled point clouds measured from an onboard lidar are used as input data to generate predicted road points that are out of range or occluded in the original point-cloud scan. Then the input pointcloud and predicted terrain are concatenated to the terrain-extended pointcloud. We show promising qualitative results from these methods, as well as discussion for potential quantitative metrics to evaluate the overall success of our framework. Finally, we discuss improvements that can be made to the framework for successful generalization to test sets.
