Model: Windowed-FourierMixer: Enhancing Clutter-Free Room Modeling with Fourier Transform
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18287v1.pdf
Summary: With the growing demand for immersive digital applications, the need to understand and reconstruct 3D scenes has significantly increased. In this context, inpainting indoor environments from a single image plays a crucial role in modeling the internal structure of interior spaces as it enables the creation of textured and clutter-free reconstructions. While recent methods have shown significant progress in room modeling, they rely on constraining layout estimators to guide the reconstruction process. These methods are highly dependent on the performance of the structure estimator and its generative ability in heavily occluded environments. In response to these issues, we propose an innovative approach based on a U-Former architecture and a new Windowed-FourierMixer block, resulting in a unified, single-phase network capable of effectively handle human-made periodic structures such as indoor spaces. This new architecture proves advantageous for tasks involving indoor scenes where symmetry is prevalent, allowing the model to effectively capture features such as horizon/ceiling height lines and cuboid-shaped rooms. Experiments show the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on the Structured3D dataset demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative results. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Model: Unveiling Spaces: Architecturally meaningful semantic descriptions from images of interior spaces
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12481v1.pdf
Summary: There has been a growing adoption of computer vision tools and technologies in architectural design workflows over the past decade. Notable use cases include point cloud generation, visual content analysis, and spatial awareness for robotic fabrication. Multiple image classification, object detection, and semantic pixel segmentation models have become popular for the extraction of high-level symbolic descriptions and semantic content from two-dimensional images and videos. However, a major challenge in this regard has been the extraction of high-level architectural structures (walls, floors, ceilings windows etc.) from diverse imagery where parts of these elements are occluded by furniture, people, or other non-architectural elements. This project aims to tackle this problem by proposing models that are capable of extracting architecturally meaningful semantic descriptions from two-dimensional scenes of populated interior spaces. 1000 virtual classrooms are parametrically generated, randomized along key spatial parameters such as length, width, height, and door/window positions. The positions of cameras, and non-architectural visual obstructions (furniture/objects) are also randomized. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for image-to-image translation (Pix2Pix) is trained on synthetically generated rendered images of these enclosures, along with corresponding image abstractions representing high-level architectural structure. The model is then tested on unseen synthetic imagery of new enclosures, and outputs are compared to ground truth using pixel-wise comparison for evaluation. A similar model evaluation is also carried out on photographs of existing indoor enclosures, to measure its performance in real-world settings.

Model: FaGeL: Fabric LLMs Agent empowered Embodied Intelligence Evolution with Autonomous Human-Machine Collaboration
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20297v1.pdf
Summary: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents, driving progress toward AGI-powered robotics. While LLMs have been applied to tasks like semantic reasoning and task generalization, their potential in open physical space exploration remains underexplored. This paper introduces FaGeL (Fabric aGent empowered by embodied intelligence with LLMs), an embodied agent integrating smart fabric technology for seamless, non-intrusive human-agent interaction. FaGeL autonomously generates tasks using multimodal data from wearable and ambient sensors, refining its behavior based on implicit human feedback in generated text, without explicit ratings or preferences. We also introduce a token-level saliency map to visualize LLM fine-tuning, enhancing the interpretability of token-level alignment. The system leverages dual feedback mechanisms to improve token-level alignment and addresses challenges in non-intrusive human-machine interaction and cognition evolution. Our contributions include FaGeL's development, the DualCUT algorithm for AI alignment, and experimental validation in cooperative tasks, demonstrating FaGeL's ability to adapt and evolve autonomously through implicit feedback. In the future, we plan to explore FaGeL's scalability in dynamic environments and its integration with other AI systems to develop AGI agents that adapt seamlessly to diverse human needs.
