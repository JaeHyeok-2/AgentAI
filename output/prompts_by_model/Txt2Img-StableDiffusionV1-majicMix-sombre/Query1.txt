Model: Leveraging Content and Context Cues for Low-Light Image Enhancement
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07693v1.pdf

Summary: Low-light conditions have an adverse impact on machine cognition, limiting the performance of computer vision systems in real life. Since low-light data is limited and difficult to annotate, we focus on image processing to enhance low-light images and improve the performance of any downstream task model, instead of fine-tuning each of the models which can be prohibitively expensive. We propose to improve the existing zero-reference low-light enhancement by leveraging the CLIP model to capture image prior and for semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a data augmentation strategy to learn an image prior via prompt learning, based on image sampling, to learn the image prior without any need for paired or unpaired normal-light data. Next, we propose a semantic guidance strategy that maximally takes advantage of existing low-light annotation by introducing both content and context cues about the image training patches. We experimentally show, in a qualitative study, that the proposed prior and semantic guidance help to improve the overall image contrast and hue, as well as improve background-foreground discrimination, resulting in reduced over-saturation and noise over-amplification, common in related zero-reference methods. As we target machine cognition, rather than rely on assuming the correlation between human perception and downstream task performance, we conduct and present an ablation study and comparison with related zero-reference methods in terms of task-based performance across many low-light datasets, including image classification, object and face detection, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Model: LIME-Eval: Rethinking Low-light Image Enhancement Evaluation via Object Detection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08810v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/lime-j/lime-eval
Summary: Due to the nature of enhancement--the absence of paired ground-truth information, high-level vision tasks have been recently employed to evaluate the performance of low-light image enhancement. A widely-used manner is to see how accurately an object detector trained on enhanced low-light images by different candidates can perform with respect to annotated semantic labels. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the mentioned approach is generally prone to overfitting, and thus diminishes its measurement reliability. In search of a proper evaluation metric, we propose LIME-Bench, the first online benchmark platform designed to collect human preferences for low-light enhancement, providing a valuable dataset for validating the correlation between human perception and automated evaluation metrics. We then customize LIME-Eval, a novel evaluation framework that utilizes detectors pre-trained on standard-lighting datasets without object annotations, to judge the quality of enhanced images. By adopting an energy-based strategy to assess the accuracy of output confidence maps, our LIME-Eval can simultaneously bypass biases associated with retraining detectors and circumvent the reliance on annotations for dim images. Comprehensive experiments are provided to reveal the effectiveness of our LIME-Eval. Our benchmark platform (https://huggingface.co/spaces/lime-j/eval) and code (https://github.com/lime-j/lime-eval) are available online.

Model: On the connection between least squares, regularization, and classical shadows
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16921v4.pdf
Summary: Classical shadows (CS) offer a resource-efficient means to estimate quantum observables, circumventing the need for exhaustive state tomography. Here, we clarify and explore the connection between CS techniques and least squares (LS) and regularized least squares (RLS) methods commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. By formal identification of LS and RLS "shadows" completely analogous to those in CS -- namely, point estimators calculated from the empirical frequencies of single measurements -- we show that both RLS and CS can be viewed as regularizers for the underdetermined regime, replacing the pseudoinverse with invertible alternatives. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate RLS and CS from three distinct angles: the tradeoff in bias and variance, mismatch between the expected and actual measurement distributions, and the interplay between the number of measurements and number of shots per measurement. Compared to CS, RLS attains lower variance at the expense of bias, is robust to distribution mismatch, and is more sensitive to the number of shots for a fixed number of state copies -- differences that can be understood from the distinct approaches taken to regularization. Conceptually, our integration of LS, RLS, and CS under a unifying "shadow" umbrella aids in advancing the overall picture of CS techniques, while practically our results highlight the tradeoffs intrinsic to these measurement approaches, illuminating the circumstances under which either RLS or CS would be preferred, such as unverified randomness for the former or unbiased estimation for the latter.
