You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I typed just a few words, and the image came out with dramatic shadows and soft lighting like a movie still. How does the model bring out such a specific visual tone so easily?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: LLaVAR: Enhanced Visual Instruction Tuning for Text-Rich Image Understanding
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17107v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/SALT-NLP/LLaVAR
Summary: Instruction tuning unlocks the superior capability of Large Language Models (LLM) to interact with humans. Furthermore, recent instruction-following datasets include images as visual inputs, collecting responses for image-based instructions. However, visual instruction-tuned models cannot comprehend textual details within images well. This work enhances the current visual instruction tuning pipeline with text-rich images (e.g., movie posters, book covers, etc.). Specifically, we first use publicly available OCR tools to collect results on 422K text-rich images from the LAION dataset. Moreover, we prompt text-only GPT-4 with recognized texts and image captions to generate 16K conversations, each containing question-answer pairs for text-rich images. By combining our collected data with previous multi-modal instruction-following data, our model, LLaVAR, substantially improves the LLaVA model's capability on text-based VQA datasets (up to 20% accuracy improvement) while achieving an accuracy of 91.42% on ScienceQA. The GPT-4-based instruction-following evaluation also demonstrates the improvement of our model on both natural images and text-rich images. Through qualitative analysis, LLaVAR shows promising interaction (e.g., reasoning, writing, and elaboration) skills with humans based on the latest real-world online content that combines text and images.

Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06657v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/felixcheng97/agap
Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

Model: Zero-shot Translation of Attention Patterns in VQA Models to Natural Language
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05043v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/explainableml/zs-a2t
Summary: Converting a model's internals to text can yield human-understandable insights about the model. Inspired by the recent success of training-free approaches for image captioning, we propose ZS-A2T, a zero-shot framework that translates the transformer attention of a given model into natural language without requiring any training. We consider this in the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA). ZS-A2T builds on a pre-trained large language model (LLM), which receives a task prompt, question, and predicted answer, as inputs. The LLM is guided to select tokens which describe the regions in the input image that the VQA model attended to. Crucially, we determine this similarity by exploiting the text-image matching capabilities of the underlying VQA model. Our framework does not require any training and allows the drop-in replacement of different guiding sources (e.g. attribution instead of attention maps), or language models. We evaluate this novel task on textual explanation datasets for VQA, giving state-of-the-art performances for the zero-shot setting on GQA-REX and VQA-X.
