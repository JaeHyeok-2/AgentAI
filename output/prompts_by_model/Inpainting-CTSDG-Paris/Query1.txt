Model: SimpliCity: Reconstructing Buildings with Simple Regularized 3D Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08104v1.pdf
Summary: Automatic methods for reconstructing buildings from airborne LiDAR point clouds focus on producing accurate 3D models in a fast and scalable manner, but they overlook the problem of delivering simple and regularized models to practitioners. As a result, output meshes often suffer from connectivity approximations around corners with either the presence of multiple vertices and tiny facets, or the necessity to break the planarity constraint on roof sections and facade components. We propose a 2D planimetric arrangement-based framework to address this problem. We first regularize, not the 3D planes as commonly done in the literature, but a 2D polyhedral partition constructed from the planes. Second, we extrude this partition to 3D by an optimization process that guarantees the planarity of the roof sections as well as the preservation of the vertical discontinuities and horizontal rooftop edges. We show the benefits of our approach against existing methods by producing simpler 3D models while offering a similar fidelity and efficiency.

Model: ResBuilder: Automated Learning of Depth with Residual Structures
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08504v1.pdf
Summary: In this work, we develop a neural architecture search algorithm, termed Resbuilder, that develops ResNet architectures from scratch that achieve high accuracy at moderate computational cost. It can also be used to modify existing architectures and has the capability to remove and insert ResNet blocks, in this way searching for suitable architectures in the space of ResNet architectures. In our experiments on different image classification datasets, Resbuilder achieves close to state-of-the-art performance while saving computational cost compared to off-the-shelf ResNets. Noteworthy, we once tune the parameters on CIFAR10 which yields a suitable default choice for all other datasets. We demonstrate that this property generalizes even to industrial applications by applying our method with default parameters on a proprietary fraud detection dataset.

Model: MLS2LoD3: Refining low LoDs building models with MLS point clouds to reconstruct semantic LoD3 building models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06288v1.pdf
Summary: Although highly-detailed LoD3 building models reveal great potential in various applications, they have yet to be available. The primary challenges in creating such models concern not only automatic detection and reconstruction but also standard-consistent modeling. In this paper, we introduce a novel refinement strategy enabling LoD3 reconstruction by leveraging the ubiquity of lower LoD building models and the accuracy of MLS point clouds. Such a strategy promises at-scale LoD3 reconstruction and unlocks LoD3 applications, which we also describe and illustrate in this paper. Additionally, we present guidelines for reconstructing LoD3 facade elements and their embedding into the CityGML standard model, disseminating gained knowledge to academics and professionals. We believe that our method can foster development of LoD3 reconstruction algorithms and subsequently enable their wider adoption.
