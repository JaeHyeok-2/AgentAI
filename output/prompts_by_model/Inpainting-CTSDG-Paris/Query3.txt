Model: SimpliCity: Reconstructing Buildings with Simple Regularized 3D Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08104v1.pdf
Summary: Automatic methods for reconstructing buildings from airborne LiDAR point clouds focus on producing accurate 3D models in a fast and scalable manner, but they overlook the problem of delivering simple and regularized models to practitioners. As a result, output meshes often suffer from connectivity approximations around corners with either the presence of multiple vertices and tiny facets, or the necessity to break the planarity constraint on roof sections and facade components. We propose a 2D planimetric arrangement-based framework to address this problem. We first regularize, not the 3D planes as commonly done in the literature, but a 2D polyhedral partition constructed from the planes. Second, we extrude this partition to 3D by an optimization process that guarantees the planarity of the roof sections as well as the preservation of the vertical discontinuities and horizontal rooftop edges. We show the benefits of our approach against existing methods by producing simpler 3D models while offering a similar fidelity and efficiency.

Model: MLS2LoD3: Refining low LoDs building models with MLS point clouds to reconstruct semantic LoD3 building models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06288v1.pdf
Summary: Although highly-detailed LoD3 building models reveal great potential in various applications, they have yet to be available. The primary challenges in creating such models concern not only automatic detection and reconstruction but also standard-consistent modeling. In this paper, we introduce a novel refinement strategy enabling LoD3 reconstruction by leveraging the ubiquity of lower LoD building models and the accuracy of MLS point clouds. Such a strategy promises at-scale LoD3 reconstruction and unlocks LoD3 applications, which we also describe and illustrate in this paper. Additionally, we present guidelines for reconstructing LoD3 facade elements and their embedding into the CityGML standard model, disseminating gained knowledge to academics and professionals. We believe that our method can foster development of LoD3 reconstruction algorithms and subsequently enable their wider adoption.

Model: ARCH2S: Dataset, Benchmark and Challenges for Learning Exterior Architectural Structures from Point Clouds
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01337v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/Semanticity-Research/ARCH2S
Summary: Precise segmentation of architectural structures provides detailed information about various building components, enhancing our understanding and interaction with our built environment. Nevertheless, existing outdoor 3D point cloud datasets have limited and detailed annotations on architectural exteriors due to privacy concerns and the expensive costs of data acquisition and annotation. To overcome this shortfall, this paper introduces a semantically-enriched, photo-realistic 3D architectural models dataset and benchmark for semantic segmentation. It features 4 different building purposes of real-world buildings as well as an open architectural landscape in Hong Kong. Each point cloud is annotated into one of 14 semantic classes.
