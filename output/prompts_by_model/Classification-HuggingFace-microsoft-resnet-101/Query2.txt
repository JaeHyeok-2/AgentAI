Model: Real-time Traffic Object Detection for Autonomous Driving
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00128v2.pdf
Summary: With recent advances in computer vision, it appears that autonomous driving will be part of modern society sooner rather than later. However, there are still a significant number of concerns to address. Although modern computer vision techniques demonstrate superior performance, they tend to prioritize accuracy over efficiency, which is a crucial aspect of real-time applications. Large object detection models typically require higher computational power, which is achieved by using more sophisticated onboard hardware. For autonomous driving, these requirements translate to increased fuel costs and, ultimately, a reduction in mileage. Further, despite their computational demands, the existing object detectors are far from being real-time. In this research, we assess the robustness of our previously proposed, highly efficient pedestrian detector LSFM on well-established autonomous driving benchmarks, including diverse weather conditions and nighttime scenes. Moreover, we extend our LSFM model for general object detection to achieve real-time object detection in traffic scenes. We evaluate its performance, low latency, and generalizability on traffic object detection datasets. Furthermore, we discuss the inadequacy of the current key performance indicator employed by object detection systems in the context of autonomous driving and propose a more suitable alternative that incorporates real-time requirements.

Model: AI Powered Road Network Prediction with Multi-Modal Data
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17040v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/nagellette/sentinel_traj_nn
Summary: This study presents an innovative approach for automatic road detection with deep learning, by employing fusion strategies for utilizing both lower-resolution satellite imagery and GPS trajectory data, a concept never explored before. We rigorously investigate both early and late fusion strategies, and assess deep learning based road detection performance using different fusion settings. Our extensive ablation studies assess the efficacy of our framework under diverse model architectures, loss functions, and geographic domains (Istanbul and Montreal). For an unbiased and complete evaluation of road detection results, we use both region-based and boundary-based evaluation metrics for road segmentation. The outcomes reveal that the ResUnet model outperforms U-Net and D-Linknet in road extraction tasks, achieving superior results over the benchmark study using low-resolution Sentinel-2 data. This research not only contributes to the field of automatic road detection but also offers novel insights into the utilization of data fusion methods in diverse applications.

Model: RSUD20K: A Dataset for Road Scene Understanding In Autonomous Driving
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07322v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/hasibzunair/rsud20k
Summary: Road scene understanding is crucial in autonomous driving, enabling machines to perceive the visual environment. However, recent object detectors tailored for learning on datasets collected from certain geographical locations struggle to generalize across different locations. In this paper, we present RSUD20K, a new dataset for road scene understanding, comprised of over 20K high-resolution images from the driving perspective on Bangladesh roads, and includes 130K bounding box annotations for 13 objects. This challenging dataset encompasses diverse road scenes, narrow streets and highways, featuring objects from different viewpoints and scenes from crowded environments with densely cluttered objects and various weather conditions. Our work significantly improves upon previous efforts, providing detailed annotations and increased object complexity. We thoroughly examine the dataset, benchmarking various state-of-the-art object detectors and exploring large vision models as image annotators.
