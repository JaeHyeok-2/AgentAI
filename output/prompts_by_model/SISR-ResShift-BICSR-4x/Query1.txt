You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I blew up an old landscape photo 4× and even the leaf textures came back. Older upscalers looked blocky—how does this one recover such natural detail, and what makes it run so fast?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: MBPU: A Plug-and-Play State Space Model for Point Cloud Upsamping with Fast Point Rendering
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15941v1.pdf
Summary: The task of point cloud upsampling (PCU) is to generate dense and uniform point clouds from sparse input captured by 3D sensors like LiDAR, holding potential applications in real yet is still a challenging task. Existing deep learning-based methods have shown significant achievements in this field. However, they still face limitations in effectively handling long sequences and addressing the issue of shrinkage artifacts around the surface of the point cloud. Inspired by the newly proposed Mamba, in this paper, we introduce a network named MBPU built on top of the Mamba architecture, which performs well in long sequence modeling, especially for large-scale point cloud upsampling, and achieves fast convergence speed. Moreover, MBPU is an arbitrary-scale upsampling framework as the predictor of point distance in the point refinement phase. At the same time, we simultaneously predict the 3D position shift and 1D point-to-point distance as regression quantities to constrain the global features while ensuring the accuracy of local details. We also introduce a fast differentiable renderer to further enhance the fidelity of the upsampled point cloud and reduce artifacts. It is noted that, by the merits of our fast point rendering, MBPU yields high-quality upsampled point clouds by effectively eliminating surface noise. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our MBPU outperforms other off-the-shelf methods in terms of point cloud upsampling, especially for large-scale point clouds.

Model: TULIP: Transformer for Upsampling of LiDAR Point Clouds
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06733v4.pdf

Summary: LiDAR Upsampling is a challenging task for the perception systems of robots and autonomous vehicles, due to the sparse and irregular structure of large-scale scene contexts. Recent works propose to solve this problem by converting LiDAR data from 3D Euclidean space into an image super-resolution problem in 2D image space. Although their methods can generate high-resolution range images with fine-grained details, the resulting 3D point clouds often blur out details and predict invalid points. In this paper, we propose TULIP, a new method to reconstruct high-resolution LiDAR point clouds from low-resolution LiDAR input. We also follow a range image-based approach but specifically modify the patch and window geometries of a Swin-Transformer-based network to better fit the characteristics of range images. We conducted several experiments on three public real-world and simulated datasets. TULIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all relevant metrics and generates robust and more realistic point clouds than prior works.
