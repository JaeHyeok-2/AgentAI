Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: On the Generalizability of Iterative Patch Selection for Memory-Efficient High-Resolution Image Classification

Summary: Classifying large images with small or tiny regions of interest (ROI) is challenging due to computational and memory constraints. Weakly supervised memory-efficient patch selectors have achieved results comparable with strongly supervised methods. However, low signal-to-noise ratios and low entropy attention still cause overfitting. We explore these issues using a novel testbed on a memory-efficient cross-attention transformer with Iterative Patch Selection (IPS) as the patch selection module. Our testbed extends the megapixel MNIST benchmark to four smaller O2I (object-to-image) ratios ranging from 0.01% to 0.14% while keeping the canvas size fixed and introducing a noise generation component based on B\'ezier curves. Experimental results generalize the observations made on CNNs to IPS whereby the O2I threshold below which the classifier fails to generalize is affected by the training dataset size. We further observe that the magnitude of this interaction differs for each task of the Megapixel MNIST. For tasks "Maj" and "Top", the rate is at its highest, followed by tasks "Max" and "Multi" where in the latter, this rate is almost at 0. Moreover, results show that in a low data setting, tuning the patch size to be smaller relative to the ROI improves generalization, resulting in an improvement of + 15% for the megapixel MNIST and + 5% for the Swedish traffic signs dataset compared to the original object-to-patch ratios in IPS. Further outcomes indicate that the similarity between the thickness of the noise component and the digits in the megapixel MNIST gradually causes IPS to fail to generalize, contributing to previous suspicions.

Model: Point Transformer V3: Simpler, Faster, Stronger
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10035v2.pdf

Summary: This paper is not motivated to seek innovation within the attention mechanism. Instead, it focuses on overcoming the existing trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency within the context of point cloud processing, leveraging the power of scale. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in 3D large-scale representation learning, we recognize that model performance is more influenced by scale than by intricate design. Therefore, we present Point Transformer V3 (PTv3), which prioritizes simplicity and efficiency over the accuracy of certain mechanisms that are minor to the overall performance after scaling, such as replacing the precise neighbor search by KNN with an efficient serialized neighbor mapping of point clouds organized with specific patterns. This principle enables significant scaling, expanding the receptive field from 16 to 1024 points while remaining efficient (a 3x increase in processing speed and a 10x improvement in memory efficiency compared with its predecessor, PTv2). PTv3 attains state-of-the-art results on over 20 downstream tasks that span both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Further enhanced with multi-dataset joint training, PTv3 pushes these results to a higher level.
