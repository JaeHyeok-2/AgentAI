Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: POUF: Prompt-oriented unsupervised fine-tuning for large pre-trained models

Summary: Through prompting, large-scale pre-trained models have become more expressive and powerful, gaining significant attention in recent years. Though these big models have zero-shot capabilities, in general, labeled data are still required to adapt them to downstream tasks. To overcome this critical limitation, we propose an unsupervised fine-tuning framework to directly fine-tune the model or prompt on the unlabeled target data. We demonstrate how to apply our method to both language-augmented vision and masked-language models by aligning the discrete distributions extracted from the prompts and target data. To verify our approach's applicability, we conduct extensive experiments on image classification, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference tasks. Across 13 image-related tasks and 15 language-related ones, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements over the baselines.

Model: CoF: Coarse to Fine-Grained Image Understanding for Multi-modal Large Language Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16869v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/gavin001201/cof
Summary: The impressive performance of Large Language Model (LLM) has prompted researchers to develop Multi-modal LLM (MLLM), which has shown great potential for various multi-modal tasks. However, current MLLM often struggles to effectively address fine-grained multi-modal challenges. We argue that this limitation is closely linked to the models' visual grounding capabilities. The restricted spatial awareness and perceptual acuity of visual encoders frequently lead to interference from irrelevant background information in images, causing the models to overlook subtle but crucial details. As a result, achieving fine-grained regional visual comprehension becomes difficult. In this paper, we break down multi-modal understanding into two stages, from Coarse to Fine (CoF). In the first stage, we prompt the MLLM to locate the approximate area of the answer. In the second stage, we further enhance the model's focus on relevant areas within the image through visual prompt engineering, adjusting attention weights of pertinent regions. This, in turn, improves both visual grounding and overall performance in downstream tasks. Our experiments show that this approach significantly boosts the performance of baseline models, demonstrating notable generalization and effectiveness.
