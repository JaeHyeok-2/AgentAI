Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06657v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/felixcheng97/agap
Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

Model: DreamColour: Controllable Video Colour Editing without Training
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05180v1.pdf
Summary: Video colour editing is a crucial task for content creation, yet existing solutions either require painstaking frame-by-frame manipulation or produce unrealistic results with temporal artefacts. We present a practical, training-free framework that makes precise video colour editing accessible through an intuitive interface while maintaining professional-quality output. Our key insight is that by decoupling spatial and temporal aspects of colour editing, we can better align with users' natural workflow -- allowing them to focus on precise colour selection in key frames before automatically propagating changes across time. We achieve this through a novel technical framework that combines: (i) a simple point-and-click interface merging grid-based colour selection with automatic instance segmentation for precise spatial control, (ii) bidirectional colour propagation that leverages inherent video motion patterns, and (iii) motion-aware blending that ensures smooth transitions even with complex object movements. Through extensive evaluation on diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods while eliminating the need for training or specialized hardware, making professional-quality video colour editing accessible to everyone.

Model: Robust Multi-Modal Image Stitching for Improved Scene Understanding
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17010v1.pdf
Summary: Multi-modal image stitching can be a difficult feat. That's why, in this paper, we've devised a unique and comprehensive image-stitching pipeline that taps into OpenCV's stitching module. Our approach integrates feature-based matching, transformation estimation, and blending techniques to bring about panoramic views that are of top-tier quality - irrespective of lighting, scale or orientation differences between images. We've put our pipeline to the test with a varied dataset and found that it's very effective in enhancing scene understanding and finding real-world applications.
