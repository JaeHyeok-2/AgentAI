Model: Matching Free Depth Recovery from Structured Light
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07113v1.pdf
Summary: We present a novel approach for depth estimation from images captured by structured light systems. Unlike many previous methods that rely on image matching process, our approach uses a density voxel grid to represent scene geometry, which is trained via self-supervised differentiable volume rendering. Our method leverages color fields derived from projected patterns in structured light systems during the rendering process, enabling the isolated optimization of the geometry field. This contributes to faster convergence and high-quality output. Additionally, we incorporate normalized device coordinates (NDC), a distortion loss, and a novel surface-based color loss to enhance geometric fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing matching-based techniques in geometric performance for few-shot scenarios, achieving approximately a 60% reduction in average estimated depth errors on synthetic scenes and about 30% on real-world captured scenes. Furthermore, our approach delivers fast training, with a speed roughly three times faster than previous matching-free methods that employ implicit representations.

Model: ALEN: A Dual-Approach for Uniform and Non-Uniform Low-Light Image Enhancement
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19708v4.pdf

Summary: Low-light image enhancement is an important task in computer vision, essential for improving the visibility and quality of images captured in non-optimal lighting conditions. Inadequate illumination can lead to significant information loss and poor image quality, impacting various applications such as surveillance. photography, or even autonomous driving. In this regard, automated methods have been developed to automatically adjust illumination in the image for a better visual perception. Current enhancement techniques often use specific datasets to enhance low-light images, but still present challenges when adapting to diverse real-world conditions, where illumination degradation may be localized to specific regions. To address this challenge, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, whose main approach is the use of a classification mechanism to determine whether local or global illumination enhancement is required. Subsequently, estimator networks adjust illumination based on this classification and simultaneously enhance color fidelity. ALEN integrates the Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization, complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet), and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise estimation of illumination and color, respectively. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for low-light conditions were carried out to underscore ALEN's robust generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The ALEN not only enhances image quality in terms of visual perception but also represents an advancement in high-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, as presented in this work. The code of this method is available at https://github.com/xingyumex/ALEN

Model: EvLight++: Low-Light Video Enhancement with an Event Camera: A Large-Scale Real-World Dataset, Novel Method, and More
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16254v1.pdf
Summary: Event cameras offer significant advantages for low-light video enhancement, primarily due to their high dynamic range. Current research, however, is severely limited by the absence of large-scale, real-world, and spatio-temporally aligned event-video datasets. To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset with over 30,000 pairs of frames and events captured under varying illumination. This dataset was curated using a robotic arm that traces a consistent non-linear trajectory, achieving spatial alignment precision under 0.03mm and temporal alignment with errors under 0.01s for 90% of the dataset. Based on the dataset, we propose \textbf{EvLight++}, a novel event-guided low-light video enhancement approach designed for robust performance in real-world scenarios. Firstly, we design a multi-scale holistic fusion branch to integrate structural and textural information from both images and events. To counteract variations in regional illumination and noise, we introduce Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)-guided regional feature selection, enhancing features from high SNR regions and augmenting those from low SNR regions by extracting structural information from events. To incorporate temporal information and ensure temporal coherence, we further introduce a recurrent module and temporal loss in the whole pipeline. Extensive experiments on our and the synthetic SDSD dataset demonstrate that EvLight++ significantly outperforms both single image- and video-based methods by 1.37 dB and 3.71 dB, respectively. To further explore its potential in downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation, we extend our datasets by adding pseudo segmentation and depth labels via meticulous annotation efforts with foundation models. Experiments under diverse low-light scenes show that the enhanced results achieve a 15.97% improvement in mIoU for semantic segmentation.
