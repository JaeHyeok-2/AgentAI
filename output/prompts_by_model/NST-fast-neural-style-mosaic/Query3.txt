Model: Image Triangulation Using the Sobel Operator for Vertex Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16112v1.pdf
Summary: Image triangulation, the practice of decomposing images into triangles, deliberately employs simplification to create an abstracted representation. While triangulating an image is a relatively simple process, difficulties arise when determining which vertices produce recognizable and visually pleasing output images. With the goal of producing art, we discuss an image triangulation algorithm in Python that utilizes Sobel edge detection and point cloud sparsification to determine final vertices for a triangulation, resulting in the creation of artistic triangulated compositions.

Model: Geo-Tiles for Semantic Segmentation of Earth Observation Imagery
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00823v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/SBCV/EarthObservationTiles
Summary: To cope with the high requirements during the computation of semantic segmentations of earth observation imagery, current state-of-the-art pipelines divide the corresponding data into smaller images. Existing methods and benchmark datasets oftentimes rely on pixel-based tiling schemes or on geo-tiling schemes employed by web mapping applications. The selection of subimages (comprising size, location and orientation) is crucial. It affects the available context information of each pixel, defines the number of tiles during training, and influences the degree of information degradation while down- and up-sampling the tile contents to the size required by the segmentation model. We propose a new segmentation pipeline for earth observation imagery relying on a tiling scheme that creates geo-tiles based on the geo-information of the raster data. This approach exhibits several beneficial properties compared to pixel-based or common web mapping approaches. The proposed tiling scheme shows flexible customization properties regarding tile granularity, tile stride and image boundary alignment. This allows us to perform a tile specific data augmentation during training and a substitution of pixel predictions with limited context information using data of overlapping tiles during inference. The generated tiles show a consistent spatial tile extent w.r.t. heterogeneous sensors, varying recording distances and different latitudes. We demonstrate how the proposed tiling system allows to improve the results of current state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models. To foster future research we make the source code publicly available.

Model: When Semantic Segmentation Meets Frequency Aliasing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09065v3.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/linwei-chen/seg-aliasing
Summary: Despite recent advancements in semantic segmentation, where and what pixels are hard to segment remains largely unexplored. Existing research only separates an image into easy and hard regions and empirically observes the latter are associated with object boundaries. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of hard pixel errors, categorizing them into three types: false responses, merging mistakes, and displacements. Our findings reveal a quantitative association between hard pixels and aliasing, which is distortion caused by the overlapping of frequency components in the Fourier domain during downsampling. To identify the frequencies responsible for aliasing, we propose using the equivalent sampling rate to calculate the Nyquist frequency, which marks the threshold for aliasing. Then, we introduce the aliasing score as a metric to quantify the extent of aliasing. While positively correlated with the proposed aliasing score, three types of hard pixels exhibit different patterns. Here, we propose two novel de-aliasing filter (DAF) and frequency mixing (FreqMix) modules to alleviate aliasing degradation by accurately removing or adjusting frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency. The DAF precisely removes the frequencies responsible for aliasing before downsampling, while the FreqMix dynamically selects high-frequency components within the encoder block. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic segmentation and low-light instance segmentation tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/Seg-Aliasing.
