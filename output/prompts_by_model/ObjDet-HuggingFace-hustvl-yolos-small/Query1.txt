Model: Efficiency 360: Efficient Vision Transformers
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08374v3.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/badripatro/efficient360
Summary: Transformers are widely used for solving tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, speech, and music domains. In this paper, we talk about the efficiency of transformers in terms of memory (the number of parameters), computation cost (number of floating points operations), and performance of models, including accuracy, the robustness of the model, and fair \& bias-free features. We mainly discuss the vision transformer for the image classification task. Our contribution is to introduce an efficient 360 framework, which includes various aspects of the vision transformer, to make it more efficient for industrial applications. By considering those applications, we categorize them into multiple dimensions such as privacy, robustness, transparency, fairness, inclusiveness, continual learning, probabilistic models, approximation, computational complexity, and spectral complexity. We compare various vision transformer models based on their performance, the number of parameters, and the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) on multiple datasets.

Model: Analyzing Vision Transformers for Image Classification in Class Embedding Space
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18969v1.pdf

Summary: Despite the growing use of transformer models in computer vision, a mechanistic understanding of these networks is still needed. This work introduces a method to reverse-engineer Vision Transformers trained to solve image classification tasks. Inspired by previous research in NLP, we demonstrate how the inner representations at any level of the hierarchy can be projected onto the learned class embedding space to uncover how these networks build categorical representations for their predictions. We use our framework to show how image tokens develop class-specific representations that depend on attention mechanisms and contextual information, and give insights on how self-attention and MLP layers differentially contribute to this categorical composition. We additionally demonstrate that this method (1) can be used to determine the parts of an image that would be important for detecting the class of interest, and (2) exhibits significant advantages over traditional linear probing approaches. Taken together, our results position our proposed framework as a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability and explainability research.

Model: MMViT: Multiscale Multiview Vision Transformers
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00104v1.pdf
Summary: We present Multiscale Multiview Vision Transformers (MMViT), which introduces multiscale feature maps and multiview encodings to transformer models. Our model encodes different views of the input signal and builds several channel-resolution feature stages to process the multiple views of the input at different resolutions in parallel. At each scale stage, we use a cross-attention block to fuse information across different views. This enables the MMViT model to acquire complex high-dimensional representations of the input at different resolutions. The proposed model can serve as a backbone model in multiple domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MMViT on audio and image classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.
