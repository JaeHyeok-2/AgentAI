Model: CARPE-ID: Continuously Adaptable Re-identification for Personalized Robot Assistance
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19413v2.pdf
Summary: In today's Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios, a prevailing tendency exists to assume that the robot shall cooperate with the closest individual or that the scene involves merely a singular human actor. However, in realistic scenarios, such as shop floor operations, such an assumption may not hold and personalized target recognition by the robot in crowded environments is required. To fulfil this requirement, in this work, we propose a person re-identification module based on continual visual adaptation techniques that ensure the robot's seamless cooperation with the appropriate individual even subject to varying visual appearances or partial or complete occlusions. We test the framework singularly using recorded videos in a laboratory environment and an HRI scenario, i.e., a person-following task by a mobile robot. The targets are asked to change their appearance during tracking and to disappear from the camera field of view to test the challenging cases of occlusion and outfit variations. We compare our framework with one of the state-of-the-art Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) methods and the results show that the CARPE-ID can accurately track each selected target throughout the experiments in all the cases (except two limit cases). At the same time, the s-o-t-a MOT has a mean of 4 tracking errors for each video.

Model: A Little Bit Attention Is All You Need for Person Re-Identification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14574v1.pdf
Summary: Person re-identification plays a key role in applications where a mobile robot needs to track its users over a long period of time, even if they are partially unobserved for some time, in order to follow them or be available on demand. In this context, deep-learning based real-time feature extraction on a mobile robot is often performed on special-purpose devices whose computational resources are shared for multiple tasks. Therefore, the inference speed has to be taken into account. In contrast, person re-identification is often improved by architectural changes that come at the cost of significantly slowing down inference. Attention blocks are one such example. We will show that some well-performing attention blocks used in the state of the art are subject to inference costs that are far too high to justify their use for mobile robotic applications. As a consequence, we propose an attention block that only slightly affects the inference speed while keeping up with much deeper networks or more complex attention blocks in terms of re-identification accuracy. We perform extensive neural architecture search to derive rules at which locations this attention block should be integrated into the architecture in order to achieve the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. Finally, we confirm that the best performing configuration on a re-identification benchmark also performs well on an indoor robotic dataset.

Model: Human-centric Behavior Description in Videos: New Benchmark and Model
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02894v1.pdf
Summary: In the domain of video surveillance, describing the behavior of each individual within the video is becoming increasingly essential, especially in complex scenarios with multiple individuals present. This is because describing each individual's behavior provides more detailed situational analysis, enabling accurate assessment and response to potential risks, ensuring the safety and harmony of public places. Currently, video-level captioning datasets cannot provide fine-grained descriptions for each individual's specific behavior. However, mere descriptions at the video-level fail to provide an in-depth interpretation of individual behaviors, making it challenging to accurately determine the specific identity of each individual. To address this challenge, we construct a human-centric video surveillance captioning dataset, which provides detailed descriptions of the dynamic behaviors of 7,820 individuals. Specifically, we have labeled several aspects of each person, such as location, clothing, and interactions with other elements in the scene, and these people are distributed across 1,012 videos. Based on this dataset, we can link individuals to their respective behaviors, allowing for further analysis of each person's behavior in surveillance videos. Besides the dataset, we propose a novel video captioning approach that can describe individual behavior in detail on a person-level basis, achieving state-of-the-art results. To facilitate further research in this field, we intend to release our dataset and code.
