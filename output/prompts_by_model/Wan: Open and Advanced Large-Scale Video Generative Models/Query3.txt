Model: Movie2Story: A framework for understanding videos and telling stories in the form of novel text
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14965v2.pdf
Summary: In recent years, large-scale models have achieved significant advancements, accompanied by the emergence of numerous high-quality benchmarks for evaluating various aspects of their comprehension abilities. However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on spatial understanding in static image tasks. While some benchmarks extend evaluations to temporal tasks, they fall short in assessing text generation under complex contexts involving long videos and rich auxiliary information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel benchmark: the Multi-modal Story Generation Benchmark (MSBench), designed to evaluate text generation capabilities in scenarios enriched with auxiliary information. Our work introduces an innovative automatic dataset generation method to ensure the availability of accurate auxiliary information. On one hand, we leverage existing datasets and apply automated processes to generate new evaluation datasets, significantly reducing manual efforts. On the other hand, we refine auxiliary data through systematic filtering and utilize state-of-the-art models to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the ground-truth datasets. Our experiments reveal that current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform suboptimally under the proposed evaluation metrics, highlighting significant gaps in their capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture and methodology to better handle the overall process, demonstrating improvements on our benchmark.

Model: MovieFactory: Automatic Movie Creation from Text using Large Generative Models for Language and Images
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07257v1.pdf
Summary: In this paper, we present MovieFactory, a powerful framework to generate cinematic-picture (3072$\times$1280), film-style (multi-scene), and multi-modality (sounding) movies on the demand of natural languages. As the first fully automated movie generation model to the best of our knowledge, our approach empowers users to create captivating movies with smooth transitions using simple text inputs, surpassing existing methods that produce soundless videos limited to a single scene of modest quality. To facilitate this distinctive functionality, we leverage ChatGPT to expand user-provided text into detailed sequential scripts for movie generation. Then we bring scripts to life visually and acoustically through vision generation and audio retrieval. To generate videos, we extend the capabilities of a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model through a two-stage process. Firstly, we employ spatial finetuning to bridge the gap between the pretrained image model and the new video dataset. Subsequently, we introduce temporal learning to capture object motion. In terms of audio, we leverage sophisticated retrieval models to select and align audio elements that correspond to the plot and visual content of the movie. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MovieFactory produces movies with realistic visuals, diverse scenes, and seamlessly fitting audio, offering users a novel and immersive experience. Generated samples can be found in YouTube or Bilibili (1080P).

Model: StoryBench: A Multifaceted Benchmark for Continuous Story Visualization
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11606v2.pdf

Summary: Generating video stories from text prompts is a complex task. In addition to having high visual quality, videos need to realistically adhere to a sequence of text prompts whilst being consistent throughout the frames. Creating a benchmark for video generation requires data annotated over time, which contrasts with the single caption used often in video datasets. To fill this gap, we collect comprehensive human annotations on three existing datasets, and introduce StoryBench: a new, challenging multi-task benchmark to reliably evaluate forthcoming text-to-video models. Our benchmark includes three video generation tasks of increasing difficulty: action execution, where the next action must be generated starting from a conditioning video; story continuation, where a sequence of actions must be executed starting from a conditioning video; and story generation, where a video must be generated from only text prompts. We evaluate small yet strong text-to-video baselines, and show the benefits of training on story-like data algorithmically generated from existing video captions. Finally, we establish guidelines for human evaluation of video stories, and reaffirm the need of better automatic metrics for video generation. StoryBench aims at encouraging future research efforts in this exciting new area.
