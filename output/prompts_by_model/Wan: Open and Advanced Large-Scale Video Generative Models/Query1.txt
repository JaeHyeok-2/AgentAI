You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I described a scene—like “a tiger running through snow”—and it turned it into a full video that looked like a movie. How does it generate all that just from words?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Model: MovieFactory: Automatic Movie Creation from Text using Large Generative Models for Language and Images
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07257v1.pdf
Summary: In this paper, we present MovieFactory, a powerful framework to generate cinematic-picture (3072$\times$1280), film-style (multi-scene), and multi-modality (sounding) movies on the demand of natural languages. As the first fully automated movie generation model to the best of our knowledge, our approach empowers users to create captivating movies with smooth transitions using simple text inputs, surpassing existing methods that produce soundless videos limited to a single scene of modest quality. To facilitate this distinctive functionality, we leverage ChatGPT to expand user-provided text into detailed sequential scripts for movie generation. Then we bring scripts to life visually and acoustically through vision generation and audio retrieval. To generate videos, we extend the capabilities of a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model through a two-stage process. Firstly, we employ spatial finetuning to bridge the gap between the pretrained image model and the new video dataset. Subsequently, we introduce temporal learning to capture object motion. In terms of audio, we leverage sophisticated retrieval models to select and align audio elements that correspond to the plot and visual content of the movie. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MovieFactory produces movies with realistic visuals, diverse scenes, and seamlessly fitting audio, offering users a novel and immersive experience. Generated samples can be found in YouTube or Bilibili (1080P).

Model: Movie2Story: A framework for understanding videos and telling stories in the form of novel text
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14965v2.pdf
Summary: In recent years, large-scale models have achieved significant advancements, accompanied by the emergence of numerous high-quality benchmarks for evaluating various aspects of their comprehension abilities. However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on spatial understanding in static image tasks. While some benchmarks extend evaluations to temporal tasks, they fall short in assessing text generation under complex contexts involving long videos and rich auxiliary information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel benchmark: the Multi-modal Story Generation Benchmark (MSBench), designed to evaluate text generation capabilities in scenarios enriched with auxiliary information. Our work introduces an innovative automatic dataset generation method to ensure the availability of accurate auxiliary information. On one hand, we leverage existing datasets and apply automated processes to generate new evaluation datasets, significantly reducing manual efforts. On the other hand, we refine auxiliary data through systematic filtering and utilize state-of-the-art models to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the ground-truth datasets. Our experiments reveal that current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform suboptimally under the proposed evaluation metrics, highlighting significant gaps in their capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture and methodology to better handle the overall process, demonstrating improvements on our benchmark.

Model: MovieChat+: Question-aware Sparse Memory for Long Video Question Answering
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17176v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/rese1f/MovieChat
Summary: Recently, integrating video foundation models and large language models to build a video understanding system can overcome the limitations of specific pre-defined vision tasks. Yet, existing methods either employ complex spatial-temporal modules or rely heavily on additional perception models to extract temporal features for video understanding, and they only perform well on short videos. For long videos, the computational complexity and memory costs associated with long-term temporal connections are significantly increased, posing additional challenges.Taking advantage of the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model, with tokens in Transformers being employed as the carriers of memory in combination with our specially designed memory mechanism, we propose MovieChat to overcome these challenges. We lift pre-trained multi-modal large language models for understanding long videos without incorporating additional trainable temporal modules, employing a zero-shot approach. MovieChat achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video understanding, along with the released MovieChat-1K benchmark with 1K long video, 2K temporal grounding labels, and 14K manual annotations for validation of the effectiveness of our method. The code along with the dataset can be accessed via the following https://github.com/rese1f/MovieChat.
