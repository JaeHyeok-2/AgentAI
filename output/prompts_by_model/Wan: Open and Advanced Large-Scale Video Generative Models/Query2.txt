Summary: In text-video retrieval, recent works have benefited from the powerful learning capabilities of pre-trained text-image foundation models (e.g., CLIP) by adapting them to the video domain. A critical problem for them is how to effectively capture the rich semantics inside the video using the image encoder of CLIP. To tackle this, state-of-the-art methods adopt complex cross-modal modeling techniques to fuse the text information into video frame representations, which, however, incurs severe efficiency issues in large-scale retrieval systems as the video representations must be recomputed online for every text query. In this paper, we discard this problematic cross-modal fusion process and aim to learn semantically-enhanced representations purely from the video, so that the video representations can be computed offline and reused for different texts. Concretely, we first introduce a spatial-temporal "Prompt Cube" into the CLIP image encoder and iteratively switch it within the encoder layers to efficiently incorporate the global video semantics into frame representations. We then propose to apply an auxiliary video captioning objective to train the frame representations, which facilitates the learning of detailed video semantics by providing fine-grained guidance in the semantic space. With a naive temporal fusion strategy (i.e., mean-pooling) on the enhanced frame representations, we obtain state-of-the-art performances on three benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, and LSMDC.

Model: Edit As You Wish: Video Caption Editing with Multi-grained User Control
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08389v3.pdf

Summary: Automatically narrating videos in natural language complying with user requests, i.e. Controllable Video Captioning task, can help people manage massive videos with desired intentions. However, existing works suffer from two shortcomings: 1) the control signal is single-grained which can not satisfy diverse user intentions; 2) the video description is generated in a single round which can not be further edited to meet dynamic needs. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{C}aption \textbf{E}diting \textbf{(VCE)} task to automatically revise an existing video description guided by multi-grained user requests. Inspired by human writing-revision habits, we design the user command as a pivotal triplet \{\textit{operation, position, attribute}\} to cover diverse user needs from coarse-grained to fine-grained. To facilitate the VCE task, we \textit{automatically} construct an open-domain benchmark dataset named VATEX-EDIT and \textit{manually} collect an e-commerce dataset called EMMAD-EDIT. We further propose a specialized small-scale model (i.e., OPA) compared with two generalist Large Multi-modal Models to perform an exhaustive analysis of the novel task. For evaluation, we adopt comprehensive metrics considering caption fluency, command-caption consistency, and video-caption alignment. Experiments reveal the task challenges of fine-grained multi-modal semantics understanding and processing. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available at https://github.com/yaolinli/VCE.

Model: CoS: Chain-of-Shot Prompting for Long Video Understanding
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06428v2.pdf
Summary: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to the need for excessive visual tokens. These tokens exceed massively the context length of MLLMs, resulting in filled by redundant task-irrelevant shots. How to select shots is an unsolved critical problem: sparse sampling risks missing key details, while exhaustive sampling overwhelms the model with irrelevant content, leading to video misunderstanding. To solve this problem, we propose Chain-of-Shot prompting (CoS). The key idea is to frame shot selection as test-time visual prompt optimisation, choosing shots adaptive to video understanding semantic task by optimising shots-task alignment. CoS has two key parts: (1) a binary video summary mechanism that performs pseudo temporal grounding, discovering a binary coding to identify task-relevant shots, and (2) a video co-reasoning module that deploys the binary coding to pair (learning to align) task-relevant positive shots with irrelevant negative shots. It embeds the optimised shot selections into the original video, facilitating a focus on relevant context to optimize long video understanding. Experiments across three baselines and five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of CoS. Code given in https://lwpyh.github.io/CoS.
