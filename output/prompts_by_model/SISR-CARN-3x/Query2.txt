Model: SeaFormer++: Squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer for Mobile Visual Recognition
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13156v6.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/fudan-zvg/seaformer
Summary: Since the introduction of Vision Transformers, the landscape of many computer vision tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation), which has been overwhelmingly dominated by CNNs, recently has significantly revolutionized. However, the computational cost and memory requirement renders these methods unsuitable on the mobile device. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer (SeaFormer) for mobile visual recognition. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K, Cityscapes, Pascal Context and COCO-Stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobilefriendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Furthermore, we incorporate a feature upsampling-based multi-resolution distillation technique, further reducing the inference latency of the proposed framework. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification and object detection problems, demonstrating the potential of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone. Our code and models are made publicly available at https://github.com/fudan-zvg/SeaFormer.

Model: PP-MobileSeg: Explore the Fast and Accurate Semantic Segmentation Model on Mobile Devices
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05152v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg
Summary: The success of transformers in computer vision has led to several attempts to adapt them for mobile devices, but their performance remains unsatisfactory in some real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose PP-MobileSeg, a semantic segmentation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on mobile devices. PP-MobileSeg comprises three novel parts: the StrideFormer backbone, the Aggregated Attention Module (AAM), and the Valid Interpolate Module (VIM). The four-stage StrideFormer backbone is built with MV3 blocks and strided SEA attention, and it is able to extract rich semantic and detailed features with minimal parameter overhead. The AAM first filters the detailed features through semantic feature ensemble voting and then combines them with semantic features to enhance the semantic information. Furthermore, we proposed VIM to upsample the downsampled feature to the resolution of the input image. It significantly reduces model latency by only interpolating classes present in the final prediction, which is the most significant contributor to overall model latency. Extensive experiments show that PP-MobileSeg achieves a superior tradeoff between accuracy, model size, and latency compared to other methods. On the ADE20K dataset, PP-MobileSeg achieves 1.57% higher accuracy in mIoU than SeaFormer-Base with 32.9% fewer parameters and 42.3% faster acceleration on Qualcomm Snapdragon 855.

Model: Atten-Transformer: A Deep Learning Framework for User App Usage Prediction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16957v1.pdf
Summary: Accurately predicting smartphone app usage patterns is crucial for user experience optimization and targeted marketing. However, existing methods struggle to capture intricate dependencies in user behavior, particularly in sparse or complex usage scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce Atten-Transformer, a novel model that integrates temporal attention with a Transformer network to dynamically identify and leverage key app usage patterns. Unlike conventional methods that primarily consider app order and duration, our approach employs a multi-dimensional feature representation, incorporating both feature encoding and temporal encoding to enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed attention mechanism effectively assigns importance to critical app usage moments, improving both model interpretability and generalization. Extensive experiments on multiple smartphone usage datasets, including LSapp and Tsinghua App Usage datasets, demonstrate that Atten-Transformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across different data splits. Specifically, our model achieves a 45.24\% improvement in HR@1 on the Tsinghua dataset (Time-based Split) and a 18.25\% improvement in HR@1 on the LSapp dataset (Cold Start Split), showcasing its robustness across diverse app usage scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of integrating adaptive attention mechanisms in mobile usage forecasting, paving the way for enhanced user engagement and resource allocation.
