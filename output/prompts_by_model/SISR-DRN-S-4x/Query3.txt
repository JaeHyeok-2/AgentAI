Model: AdaCM$^2$: On Understanding Extremely Long-Term Video with Adaptive Cross-Modality Memory Reduction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12593v1.pdf
Summary: The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled the improvement of video understanding tasks by incorporating LLMs with visual models. However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.

Model: VISTA: Enhancing Long-Duration and High-Resolution Video Understanding by Video Spatiotemporal Augmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00927v1.pdf
Summary: Current large multimodal models (LMMs) face significant challenges in processing and comprehending long-duration or high-resolution videos, which is mainly due to the lack of high-quality datasets. To address this issue from a data-centric perspective, we propose VISTA, a simple yet effective Video Spatiotemporal Augmentation framework that synthesizes long-duration and high-resolution video instruction-following pairs from existing video-caption datasets. VISTA spatially and temporally combines videos to create new synthetic videos with extended durations and enhanced resolutions, and subsequently produces question-answer pairs pertaining to these newly synthesized videos. Based on this paradigm, we develop seven video augmentation methods and curate VISTA-400K, a video instruction-following dataset aimed at enhancing long-duration and high-resolution video understanding. Finetuning various video LMMs on our data resulted in an average improvement of 3.3% across four challenging benchmarks for long-video understanding. Furthermore, we introduce the first comprehensive high-resolution video understanding benchmark HRVideoBench, on which our finetuned models achieve a 6.5% performance gain. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework.

Model: MA-LMM: Memory-Augmented Large Multimodal Model for Long-Term Video Understanding
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05726v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/boheumd/MA-LMM
Summary: With the success of large language models (LLMs), integrating the vision model into LLMs to build vision-language foundation models has gained much more interest recently. However, existing LLM-based large multimodal models (e.g., Video-LLaMA, VideoChat) can only take in a limited number of frames for short video understanding. In this study, we mainly focus on designing an efficient and effective model for long-term video understanding. Instead of trying to process more frames simultaneously like most existing work, we propose to process videos in an online manner and store past video information in a memory bank. This allows our model to reference historical video content for long-term analysis without exceeding LLMs' context length constraints or GPU memory limits. Our memory bank can be seamlessly integrated into current multimodal LLMs in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as long-video understanding, video question answering, and video captioning, and our model can achieve state-of-the-art performances across multiple datasets.
