You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"By writing “change hair color to red,” the AI altered only that specific feature without affecting anything else. How does it precisely target edits from simple instructions?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: Via thousands of papers in Explainable AI (XAI), attention maps \cite{vaswani2017attention} and feature importance maps \cite{bansal2020sam} have been established as a common means for finding how important each input feature is to an AI's decisions. It is an interesting, unexplored question whether allowing users to edit the feature importance at test time would improve a human-AI team's accuracy on downstream tasks. In this paper, we address this question by leveraging CHM-Corr, a state-of-the-art, ante-hoc explainable classifier \cite{taesiri2022visual} that first predicts patch-wise correspondences between the input and training-set images, and then bases on them to make classification decisions. We build CHM-Corr++, an interactive interface for CHM-Corr, enabling users to edit the feature importance map provided by CHM-Corr and observe updated model decisions. Via CHM-Corr++, users can gain insights into if, when, and how the model changes its outputs, improving their understanding beyond static explanations. However, our study with 18 expert users who performed 1,400 decisions finds no statistical significance that our interactive approach improves user accuracy on CUB-200 bird image classification over static explanations. This challenges the hypothesis that interactivity can boost human-AI team accuracy and raises needs for future research. We open-source CHM-Corr++, an interactive tool for editing image classifier attention (see an interactive demo here: http://137.184.82.109:7080/). We release code and data on github: https://github.com/anguyen8/chm-corr-interactive.

Model: Resolving Lexical Bias in Edit Scoping with Projector Editor Networks
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10411v2.pdf
Summary: Model editing aims to modify the outputs of large language models after they are trained. Previous approaches have often involved direct alterations to model weights, which can result in model degradation. Recent techniques avoid making modifications to the model's weights by using an adapter that applies edits to the model when triggered by semantic similarity in the representation space. We demonstrate that current adapter methods are critically vulnerable to strong lexical biases, leading to issues such as applying edits to irrelevant prompts with overlapping words. This paper presents a principled approach to learning a disentangled representation space that facilitates precise localization of edits by maintaining distance between irrelevant prompts while preserving proximity among paraphrases. In our empirical study, we show that our method (Projector Editor Networks for Model Editing - PENME) achieves state-of-the-art model editing results while being more computationally efficient during inference than previous methods and adaptable across different architectures.

Model: InstructP2P: Learning to Edit 3D Point Clouds with Text Instructions
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07154v1.pdf
Summary: Enhancing AI systems to perform tasks following human instructions can significantly boost productivity. In this paper, we present InstructP2P, an end-to-end framework for 3D shape editing on point clouds, guided by high-level textual instructions. InstructP2P extends the capabilities of existing methods by synergizing the strengths of a text-conditioned point cloud diffusion model, Point-E, and powerful language models, enabling color and geometry editing using language instructions. To train InstructP2P, we introduce a new shape editing dataset, constructed by integrating a shape segmentation dataset, off-the-shelf shape programs, and diverse edit instructions generated by a large language model, ChatGPT. Our proposed method allows for editing both color and geometry of specific regions in a single forward pass, while leaving other regions unaffected. In our experiments, InstructP2P shows generalization capabilities, adapting to novel shape categories and instructions, despite being trained on a limited amount of data.
