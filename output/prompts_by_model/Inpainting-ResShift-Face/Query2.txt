Model: SDFD: Building a Versatile Synthetic Face Image Dataset with Diverse Attributes
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17255v2.pdf
Summary: AI systems rely on extensive training on large datasets to address various tasks. However, image-based systems, particularly those used for demographic attribute prediction, face significant challenges. Many current face image datasets primarily focus on demographic factors such as age, gender, and skin tone, overlooking other crucial facial attributes like hairstyle and accessories. This narrow focus limits the diversity of the data and consequently the robustness of AI systems trained on them. This work aims to address this limitation by proposing a methodology for generating synthetic face image datasets that capture a broader spectrum of facial diversity. Specifically, our approach integrates a systematic prompt formulation strategy, encompassing not only demographics and biometrics but also non-permanent traits like make-up, hairstyle, and accessories. These prompts guide a state-of-the-art text-to-image model in generating a comprehensive dataset of high-quality realistic images and can be used as an evaluation set in face analysis systems. Compared to existing datasets, our proposed dataset proves equally or more challenging in image classification tasks while being much smaller in size.

Model: FPGA: Flexible Portrait Generation Approach
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09248v3.pdf
Summary: Portrait Fidelity Generation is a prominent research area in generative models.Current methods face challenges in generating full-body images with low-resolution faces, especially in multi-ID photo phenomenon.To tackle these issues, we propose a comprehensive system called FPGA and construct a million-level multi-modal dataset IDZoom for training.FPGA consists of Multi-Mode Fusion training strategy (MMF) and DDIM Inversion based ID Restoration inference framework (DIIR). The MMF aims to activate the specified ID in the specified facial region. The DIIR aims to address the issue of face artifacts while keeping the background.Furthermore, DIIR is plug-and-play and can be applied to any diffusion-based portrait generation method to enhance their performance. DIIR is also capable of performing face-swapping tasks and is applicable to stylized faces as well.To validate the effectiveness of FPGA, we conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that FPGA has significant advantages in both subjective and objective metrics, and achieves controllable generation in multi-ID scenarios. In addition, we accelerate the inference speed to within 2.5 seconds on a single L20 graphics card mainly based on our well designed reparameterization method, RepControlNet.

Model: Enhancing Image Matting in Real-World Scenes with Mask-Guided Iterative Refinement
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17093v1.pdf
Summary: Real-world image matting is essential for applications in content creation and augmented reality. However, it remains challenging due to the complex nature of scenes and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce Mask2Alpha, an iterative refinement framework designed to enhance semantic comprehension, instance awareness, and fine-detail recovery in image matting. Our framework leverages self-supervised Vision Transformer features as semantic priors, strengthening contextual understanding in complex scenarios. To further improve instance differentiation, we implement a mask-guided feature selection module, enabling precise targeting of objects in multi-instance settings. Additionally, a sparse convolution-based optimization scheme allows Mask2Alpha to recover high-resolution details through progressive refinement,from low-resolution semantic passes to high-resolution sparse reconstructions. Benchmarking across various real-world datasets, Mask2Alpha consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its effectiveness in accurate and efficient image matting.
