Model: Unified Data-Free Compression: Pruning and Quantization without Fine-Tuning
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07209v1.pdf
Summary: Structured pruning and quantization are promising approaches for reducing the inference time and memory footprint of neural networks. However, most existing methods require the original training dataset to fine-tune the model. This not only brings heavy resource consumption but also is not possible for applications with sensitive or proprietary data due to privacy and security concerns. Therefore, a few data-free methods are proposed to address this problem, but they perform data-free pruning and quantization separately, which does not explore the complementarity of pruning and quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Unified Data-Free Compression(UDFC), which performs pruning and quantization simultaneously without any data and fine-tuning process. Specifically, UDFC starts with the assumption that the partial information of a damaged(e.g., pruned or quantized) channel can be preserved by a linear combination of other channels, and then derives the reconstruction form from the assumption to restore the information loss due to compression. Finally, we formulate the reconstruction error between the original network and its compressed network, and theoretically deduce the closed-form solution. We evaluate the UDFC on the large-scale image classification task and obtain significant improvements over various network architectures and compression methods. For example, we achieve a 20.54% accuracy improvement on ImageNet dataset compared to SOTA method with 30% pruning ratio and 6-bit quantization on ResNet-34.

Model: Deep Selector-JPEG: Adaptive JPEG Image Compression for Computer Vision in Image classification with Human Vision Criteria
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09560v1.pdf
Summary: With limited storage/bandwidth resources, input images to Computer Vision (CV) applications that use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often encoded with JPEG that is tailored to Human Vision (HV). This paper presents Deep Selector-JPEG, an adaptive JPEG compression method that targets image classification while satisfying HV criteria. For each image, Deep Selector-JPEG selects adaptively a Quality Factor (QF) to compress the image so that a good trade-off between the Compression Ratio (CR) and DNN classifier Accuracy (Rate-Accuracy performance) can be achieved over a set of images for a variety of DNN classifiers while the MS-SSIM of such compressed image is greater than a threshold value predetermined by HV with a high probability. Deep Selector-JPEG is designed via light-weighted or heavy-weighted selector architectures. Experimental results show that in comparison with JPEG at the same CR, Deep Selector-JPEG achieves better Rate-Accuracy performance over the ImageNet validation set for all tested DNN classifiers with gains in classification accuracy between 0.2% and 1% at the same CRs while satisfying HV constraints. Deep Selector-JPEG can also roughly provide the original classification accuracy at higher CRs.

Model: DRACO-DehazeNet: An Efficient Image Dehazing Network Combining Detail Recovery and a Novel Contrastive Learning Paradigm
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14595v1.pdf
Summary: Image dehazing is crucial for clarifying images obscured by haze or fog, but current learning-based approaches is dependent on large volumes of training data and hence consumed significant computational power. Additionally, their performance is often inadequate under non-uniform or heavy haze. To address these challenges, we developed the Detail Recovery And Contrastive DehazeNet, which facilitates efficient and effective dehazing via a dense dilated inverted residual block and an attention-based detail recovery network that tailors enhancements to specific dehazed scene contexts. A major innovation is its ability to train effectively with limited data, achieved through a novel quadruplet loss-based contrastive dehazing paradigm. This approach distinctly separates hazy and clear image features while also distinguish lower-quality and higher-quality dehazed images obtained from each sub-modules of our network, thereby refining the dehazing process to a larger extent. Extensive tests on a variety of benchmarked haze datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach.
