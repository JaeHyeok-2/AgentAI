Model: SortedAP: Rethinking evaluation metrics for instance segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04887v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/looooongchen/sortedap
Summary: Designing metrics for evaluating instance segmentation revolves around comprehensively considering object detection and segmentation accuracy. However, other important properties, such as sensitivity, continuity, and equality, are overlooked in the current study. In this paper, we reveal that most existing metrics have a limited resolution of segmentation quality. They are only conditionally sensitive to the change of masks or false predictions. For certain metrics, the score can change drastically in a narrow range which could provide a misleading indication of the quality gap between results. Therefore, we propose a new metric called sortedAP, which strictly decreases with both object- and pixel-level imperfections and has an uninterrupted penalization scale over the entire domain. We provide the evaluation toolkit and experiment code at https://www.github.com/looooongChen/sortedAP.

Model: MacFormer: Semantic Segmentation with Fine Object Boundaries
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05699v1.pdf
Summary: Semantic segmentation involves assigning a specific category to each pixel in an image. While Vision Transformer-based models have made significant progress, current semantic segmentation methods often struggle with precise predictions in localized areas like object boundaries. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new semantic segmentation architecture, ``MacFormer'', which features two key components. Firstly, using learnable agent tokens, a Mutual Agent Cross-Attention (MACA) mechanism effectively facilitates the bidirectional integration of features across encoder and decoder layers. This enables better preservation of low-level features, such as elementary edges, during decoding. Secondly, a Frequency Enhancement Module (FEM) in the decoder leverages high-frequency and low-frequency components to boost features in the frequency domain, benefiting object boundaries with minimal computational complexity increase. MacFormer is demonstrated to be compatible with various network architectures and outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency on benchmark datasets ADE20K and Cityscapes under different computational constraints.

Model: EffiPerception: an Efficient Framework for Various Perception Tasks
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12317v1.pdf
Summary: The accuracy-speed-memory trade-off is always the priority to consider for several computer vision perception tasks.   Previous methods mainly focus on a single or small couple of these tasks, such as creating effective data augmentation, feature extractor, learning strategies, etc. These approaches, however, could be inherently task-specific: their proposed model's performance may depend on a specific perception task or a dataset.   Targeting to explore common learning patterns and increasing the module robustness, we propose the EffiPerception framework.   It could achieve great accuracy-speed performance with relatively low memory cost under several perception tasks: 2D Object Detection, 3D Object Detection, 2D Instance Segmentation, and 3D Point Cloud Segmentation.   Overall, the framework consists of three parts:   (1) Efficient Feature Extractors, which extract the input features for each modality. (2) Efficient Layers, plug-in plug-out layers that further process the feature representation, aggregating core learned information while pruning noisy proposals. (3) The EffiOptim, an 8-bit optimizer to further cut down the computational cost and facilitate performance stability.   Extensive experiments on the KITTI, semantic-KITTI, and COCO datasets revealed that EffiPerception could show great accuracy-speed-memory overall performance increase within the four detection and segmentation tasks, in comparison to earlier, well-respected methods.
