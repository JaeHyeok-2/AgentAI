Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15462v1.pdf
Summary: Low dynamic range (LDR) cameras cannot deal with wide dynamic range inputs, frequently leading to local overexposure issues. We present a learning-based system to reduce these artifacts without resorting to complex acquisition mechanisms like alternating exposures or costly processing that are typical of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. We propose a transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) to infer the missing HDR details. In an ablation study, we show the importance of using a multiscale DNN and train it with the proper cost function to achieve state-of-the-art quality. To aid the reconstruction of the overexposed areas, our DNN takes a reference frame from the past as an additional input. This leverages the commonly occurring temporal instabilities of autoexposure to our advantage: since well-exposed details in the current frame may be overexposed in the future, we use reinforcement learning to train a reference frame selection DNN that decides whether to adopt the current frame as a future reference. Without resorting to alternating exposures, we obtain therefore a causal, HDR hallucination algorithm with potential application in common video acquisition settings.

Model: FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16025v1.pdf
Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: On the Efficacy of Multi-scale Data Samplers for Vision Applications
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04502v1.pdf
Summary: Multi-scale resolution training has seen an increased adoption across multiple vision tasks, including classification and detection. Training with smaller resolutions enables faster training at the expense of a drop in accuracy. Conversely, training with larger resolutions has been shown to improve performance, but memory constraints often make this infeasible. In this paper, we empirically study the properties of multi-scale training procedures. We focus on variable batch size multi-scale data samplers that randomly sample an input resolution at each training iteration and dynamically adjust their batch size according to the resolution. Such samplers have been shown to improve model accuracy beyond standard training with a fixed batch size and resolution, though it is not clear why this is the case. We explore the properties of these data samplers by performing extensive experiments on ResNet-101 and validate our conclusions across multiple architectures, tasks, and datasets. We show that multi-scale samplers behave as implicit data regularizers and accelerate training speed. Compared to models trained with single-scale samplers, we show that models trained with multi-scale samplers retain or improve accuracy, while being better-calibrated and more robust to scaling and data distribution shifts. We additionally extend a multi-scale variable batch sampler with a simple curriculum that progressively grows resolutions throughout training, allowing for a compute reduction of more than 30%. We show that the benefits of multi-scale training extend to detection and instance segmentation tasks, where we observe a 37% reduction in training FLOPs along with a 3-4% mAP increase on MS-COCO using a Mask R-CNN model.
