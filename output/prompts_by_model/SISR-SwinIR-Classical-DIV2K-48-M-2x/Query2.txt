You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I used AI to zoom in on a license plate from CCTV footage, and it got surprisingly readable. How can AI enhance such fine details from blurry input?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Allowing humans to interactively guide machines where to look does not always improve human-AI team's classification accuracy

Summary: Via thousands of papers in Explainable AI (XAI), attention maps \cite{vaswani2017attention} and feature importance maps \cite{bansal2020sam} have been established as a common means for finding how important each input feature is to an AI's decisions. It is an interesting, unexplored question whether allowing users to edit the feature importance at test time would improve a human-AI team's accuracy on downstream tasks. In this paper, we address this question by leveraging CHM-Corr, a state-of-the-art, ante-hoc explainable classifier \cite{taesiri2022visual} that first predicts patch-wise correspondences between the input and training-set images, and then bases on them to make classification decisions. We build CHM-Corr++, an interactive interface for CHM-Corr, enabling users to edit the feature importance map provided by CHM-Corr and observe updated model decisions. Via CHM-Corr++, users can gain insights into if, when, and how the model changes its outputs, improving their understanding beyond static explanations. However, our study with 18 expert users who performed 1,400 decisions finds no statistical significance that our interactive approach improves user accuracy on CUB-200 bird image classification over static explanations. This challenges the hypothesis that interactivity can boost human-AI team accuracy and raises needs for future research. We open-source CHM-Corr++, an interactive tool for editing image classifier attention (see an interactive demo here: http://137.184.82.109:7080/). We release code and data on github: https://github.com/anguyen8/chm-corr-interactive.

Model: LangXAI: Integrating Large Vision Models for Generating Textual Explanations to Enhance Explainability in Visual Perception Tasks
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12525v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/hungntt/LangXAI
Summary: LangXAI is a framework that integrates Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) with advanced vision models to generate textual explanations for visual recognition tasks. Despite XAI advancements, an understanding gap persists for end-users with limited domain knowledge in artificial intelligence and computer vision. LangXAI addresses this by furnishing text-based explanations for classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation model outputs to end-users. Preliminary results demonstrate LangXAI's enhanced plausibility, with high BERTScore across tasks, fostering a more transparent and reliable AI framework on vision tasks for end-users.
