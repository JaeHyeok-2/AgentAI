Model: Explanations for Automatic Speech Recognition
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14062v1.pdf
Summary: We address quality assessment for neural network based ASR by providing explanations that help increase our understanding of the system and ultimately help build trust in the system. Compared to simple classification labels, explaining transcriptions is more challenging as judging their correctness is not straightforward and transcriptions as a variable-length sequence is not handled by existing interpretable machine learning models. We provide an explanation for an ASR transcription as a subset of audio frames that is both a minimal and sufficient cause of the transcription. To do this, we adapt existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques from image classification-Statistical Fault Localisation(SFL) and Causal. Additionally, we use an adapted version of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for ASR as a baseline in our experiments. We evaluate the quality of the explanations generated by the proposed techniques over three different ASR ,Google API, the baseline model of Sphinx, Deepspeech and 100 audio samples from the Commonvoice dataset.

Model: Reexamining Racial Disparities in Automatic Speech Recognition Performance: The Role of Confounding by Provenance
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13982v1.pdf
Summary: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models trained on large amounts of audio data are now widely used to convert speech to written text in a variety of applications from video captioning to automated assistants used in healthcare and other domains. As such, it is important that ASR models and their use is fair and equitable. Prior work examining the performance of commercial ASR systems on the Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL) demonstrated significantly worse ASR performance on African American English (AAE). The current study seeks to understand the factors underlying this disparity by examining the performance of the current state-of-the-art neural network based ASR system (Whisper, OpenAI) on the CORAAL dataset. Two key findings have been identified as a result of the current study. The first confirms prior findings of significant dialectal variation even across neighboring communities, and worse ASR performance on AAE that can be improved to some extent with fine-tuning of ASR models. The second is a novel finding not discussed in prior work on CORAAL: differences in audio recording practices within the dataset have a significant impact on ASR accuracy resulting in a ``confounding by provenance'' effect in which both language use and recording quality differ by study location. These findings highlight the need for further systematic investigation to disentangle the effects of recording quality and inherent linguistic diversity when examining the fairness and bias present in neural ASR models, as any bias in ASR accuracy may have negative downstream effects on disparities in various domains of life in which ASR technology is used.

Model: ATRI: Mitigating Multilingual Audio Text Retrieval Inconsistencies by Reducing Data Distribution Errors
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14627v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/atri-acl/atri-acl
Summary: Multilingual audio-text retrieval (ML-ATR) is a challenging task that aims to retrieve audio clips or multilingual texts from databases. However, existing ML-ATR schemes suffer from inconsistencies for instance similarity matching across languages. We theoretically analyze the inconsistency in terms of both multilingual modal alignment direction error and weight error, and propose the theoretical weight error upper bound for quantifying the inconsistency. Based on the analysis of the weight error upper bound, we find that the inconsistency problem stems from the data distribution error caused by random sampling of languages. We propose a consistent ML-ATR scheme using 1-to-k contrastive learning and audio-English co-anchor contrastive learning, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of data distribution error on recall and consistency in ML-ATR. Experimental results on the translated AudioCaps and Clotho datasets show that our scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on recall and consistency metrics for eight mainstream languages, including English.
