You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"Live recordings in cafés or streets still transcribe clearly. What’s going on under the hood that helps the AI ignore all the chaos?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: We address quality assessment for neural network based ASR by providing explanations that help increase our understanding of the system and ultimately help build trust in the system. Compared to simple classification labels, explaining transcriptions is more challenging as judging their correctness is not straightforward and transcriptions as a variable-length sequence is not handled by existing interpretable machine learning models. We provide an explanation for an ASR transcription as a subset of audio frames that is both a minimal and sufficient cause of the transcription. To do this, we adapt existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques from image classification-Statistical Fault Localisation(SFL) and Causal. Additionally, we use an adapted version of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for ASR as a baseline in our experiments. We evaluate the quality of the explanations generated by the proposed techniques over three different ASR ,Google API, the baseline model of Sphinx, Deepspeech and 100 audio samples from the Commonvoice dataset.

Model: Beyond-Voice: Towards Continuous 3D Hand Pose Tracking on Commercial Home Assistant Devices
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17477v2.pdf
Summary: The surging popularity of home assistants and their voice user interface (VUI) have made them an ideal central control hub for smart home devices. However, current form factors heavily rely on VUI, which poses accessibility and usability issues; some latest ones are equipped with additional cameras and displays, which are costly and raise privacy concerns. These concerns jointly motivate Beyond-Voice, a novel high-fidelity acoustic sensing system that allows commodity home assistant devices to track and reconstruct hand poses continuously. It transforms the home assistant into an active sonar system using its existing onboard microphones and speakers. We feed a high-resolution range profile to the deep learning model that can analyze the motions of multiple body parts and predict the 3D positions of 21 finger joints, bringing the granularity for acoustic hand tracking to the next level. It operates across different environments and users without the need for personalized training data. A user study with 11 participants in 3 different environments shows that Beyond-Voice can track joints with an average mean absolute error of 16.47mm without any training data provided by the testing subject.

Model: Sequential annotations for naturally-occurring HRI: first insights
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15097v1.pdf
Summary: We explain the methodology we developed for improving the interactions accomplished by an embedded conversational agent, drawing from Conversation Analytic sequential and multimodal analysis. The use case is a Pepper robot that is expected to inform and orient users in a library. In order to propose and learn better interactive schema, we are creating a corpus of naturally-occurring interactions that will be made available to the community. To do so, we propose an annotation practice based on some theoretical underpinnings about the use of language and multimodal resources in human-robot interaction.
