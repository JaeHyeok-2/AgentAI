Model: DRACO-DehazeNet: An Efficient Image Dehazing Network Combining Detail Recovery and a Novel Contrastive Learning Paradigm
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14595v1.pdf
Summary: Image dehazing is crucial for clarifying images obscured by haze or fog, but current learning-based approaches is dependent on large volumes of training data and hence consumed significant computational power. Additionally, their performance is often inadequate under non-uniform or heavy haze. To address these challenges, we developed the Detail Recovery And Contrastive DehazeNet, which facilitates efficient and effective dehazing via a dense dilated inverted residual block and an attention-based detail recovery network that tailors enhancements to specific dehazed scene contexts. A major innovation is its ability to train effectively with limited data, achieved through a novel quadruplet loss-based contrastive dehazing paradigm. This approach distinctly separates hazy and clear image features while also distinguish lower-quality and higher-quality dehazed images obtained from each sub-modules of our network, thereby refining the dehazing process to a larger extent. Extensive tests on a variety of benchmarked haze datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach.

Model: Unpaired Image Dehazing via Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformation of Latent Features
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07812v1.pdf
Summary: This paper proposes an innovative framework for Unsupervised Image Dehazing via Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformation, termed UID-KAT. Image dehazing is recognized as a challenging and ill-posed vision task that requires complex transformations and interpretations in the feature space. Recent advancements have introduced Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) since KANs can leverage their polynomial foundation to more efficiently approximate complex functions while requiring fewer layers than MLPs. Motivated by this potential, this paper explores the use of KANs combined with adversarial training and contrastive learning to model the intricate relationship between hazy and clear images. Adversarial training is employed due to its capacity in producing high-fidelity images, and contrastive learning promotes the model's emphasis on significant features while suppressing the influence of irrelevant information. The proposed UID-KAT framework is trained in an unsupervised setting to take advantage of the abundance of real-world data and address the challenge of preparing paired hazy/clean images. Experimental results show that UID-KAT achieves state-of-the-art dehazing performance across multiple datasets and scenarios, outperforming existing unpaired methods while reducing model complexity.

Model: RecolorCloud: A Point Cloud Tool for Recoloring, Segmentation, and Conversion
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12470v1.pdf
Summary: Point clouds are a 3D space representation of an environment that was recorded with a high precision laser scanner. These scanners can suffer from environmental interference such as surface shading, texturing, and reflections. Because of this, point clouds may be contaminated with fake or incorrect colors. Current open source or proprietary tools offer limited or no access to correcting these visual errors automatically.   RecolorCloud is a tool developed to resolve these color conflicts by utilizing automated color recoloring. We offer the ability to deleting or recoloring outlier points automatically with users only needing to specify bounding box regions to effect colors. Results show a vast improvement of the photo-realistic quality of large point clouds. Additionally, users can quickly recolor a point cloud with set semantic segmentation colors.
