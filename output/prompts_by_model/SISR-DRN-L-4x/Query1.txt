Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: DebSDF: Delving into the Details and Bias of Neural Indoor Scene Reconstruction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15536v3.pdf
Summary: In recent years, the neural implicit surface has emerged as a powerful representation for multi-view surface reconstruction due to its simplicity and state-of-the-art performance. However, reconstructing smooth and detailed surfaces in indoor scenes from multi-view images presents unique challenges. Indoor scenes typically contain large texture-less regions, making the photometric loss unreliable for optimizing the implicit surface. Previous work utilizes monocular geometry priors to improve the reconstruction in indoor scenes. However, monocular priors often contain substantial errors in thin structure regions due to domain gaps and the inherent inconsistencies when derived independently from different views. This paper presents \textbf{DebSDF} to address these challenges, focusing on the utilization of uncertainty in monocular priors and the bias in SDF-based volume rendering. We propose an uncertainty modeling technique that associates larger uncertainties with larger errors in the monocular priors. High-uncertainty priors are then excluded from optimization to prevent bias. This uncertainty measure also informs an importance-guided ray sampling and adaptive smoothness regularization, enhancing the learning of fine structures. We further introduce a bias-aware signed distance function to density transformation that takes into account the curvature and the angle between the view direction and the SDF normals to reconstruct fine details better. Our approach has been validated through extensive experiments on several challenging datasets, demonstrating improved qualitative and quantitative results in reconstructing thin structures in indoor scenes, thereby outperforming previous work.

Model: Enhancing the Reliability of LiDAR Point Cloud Sampling: A Colorization and Super-Resolution Approach Based on LiDAR-Generated Images
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11532v1.pdf
Summary: Modern lidar systems can produce not only dense point clouds but also 360 degrees low-resolution images. This advancement facilitates the application of deep learning (DL) techniques initially developed for conventional RGB cameras and simplifies fusion of point cloud data and images without complex processes like lidar-camera calibration. Compared to RGB images from traditional cameras, lidar-generated images show greater robustness under low-light and harsh conditions, such as foggy weather. However, these images typically have lower resolution and often appear overly dark. While various studies have explored DL-based computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and keypoint detection on lidar imagery, other potentially valuable techniques remain underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive review and qualitative analysis of DL-based colorization and super-resolution methods applied to lidar imagery. Additionally, we assess the computational performance of these approaches, offering insights into their suitability for downstream robotic and autonomous system applications like odometry and 3D reconstruction.
