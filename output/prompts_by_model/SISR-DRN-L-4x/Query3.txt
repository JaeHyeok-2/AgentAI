Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03656v1.pdf
Summary: Dataset distillation is the concept of condensing large datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While previous research has primarily focused on image classification, its application to image Super-Resolution (SR) remains underexplored. This exploratory work studies multiple dataset distillation techniques applied to SR, including pixel- and latent-space approaches under different aspects. Our experiments demonstrate that a 91.12% dataset size reduction can be achieved while maintaining comparable SR performance to the full dataset. We further analyze initialization strategies and distillation methods to optimize memory efficiency and computational costs. Our findings provide new insights into dataset distillation for SR and set the stage for future advancements.

Model: Spatially-Adaptive Feature Modulation for Efficient Image Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13800v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/sunny2109/safmn
Summary: Although numerous solutions have been proposed for image super-resolution, they are usually incompatible with low-power devices with many computational and memory constraints. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a simple yet effective deep network to solve image super-resolution efficiently. In detail, we develop a spatially-adaptive feature modulation (SAFM) mechanism upon a vision transformer (ViT)-like block. Within it, we first apply the SAFM block over input features to dynamically select representative feature representations. As the SAFM block processes the input features from a long-range perspective, we further introduce a convolutional channel mixer (CCM) to simultaneously extract local contextual information and perform channel mixing. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is $3\times$ smaller than state-of-the-art efficient SR methods, e.g., IMDN, in terms of the network parameters and requires less computational cost while achieving comparable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/sunny2109/SAFMN.

Model: FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16025v1.pdf
Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.
