You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I turned my selfie into a cartoon character with big eyes and clean lines—perfect for a sticker pack. How does AI extract cartoon traits from a real photo, and what kind of data does it learn from to keep the style consistent?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: In the evolving landscape of deep learning, there is a pressing need for more comprehensive datasets capable of training models across multiple modalities. Concurrently, in digital humanities, there is a growing demand to leverage technology for diverse media adaptation and creation, yet limited by sparse datasets due to copyright and stylistic constraints. Addressing this gap, our paper presents a novel dataset comprising Franco-Belgian comics from the 1950s annotated for tasks including depth estimation, semantic segmentation, saliency detection, and character identification. It consists of two distinct and consistent styles and incorporates object concepts and labels taken from natural images. By including such diverse information across styles, this dataset not only holds promise for computational creativity but also offers avenues for the digitization of art and storytelling innovation. This dataset is a crucial component of the AI4VA Workshop Challenges~\url{https://sites.google.com/view/ai4vaeccv2024}, where we specifically explore depth and saliency.

Model: SDFD: Building a Versatile Synthetic Face Image Dataset with Diverse Attributes
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17255v2.pdf
Summary: AI systems rely on extensive training on large datasets to address various tasks. However, image-based systems, particularly those used for demographic attribute prediction, face significant challenges. Many current face image datasets primarily focus on demographic factors such as age, gender, and skin tone, overlooking other crucial facial attributes like hairstyle and accessories. This narrow focus limits the diversity of the data and consequently the robustness of AI systems trained on them. This work aims to address this limitation by proposing a methodology for generating synthetic face image datasets that capture a broader spectrum of facial diversity. Specifically, our approach integrates a systematic prompt formulation strategy, encompassing not only demographics and biometrics but also non-permanent traits like make-up, hairstyle, and accessories. These prompts guide a state-of-the-art text-to-image model in generating a comprehensive dataset of high-quality realistic images and can be used as an evaluation set in face analysis systems. Compared to existing datasets, our proposed dataset proves equally or more challenging in image classification tasks while being much smaller in size.

Model: Toon3D: Seeing Cartoons from New Perspectives
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10320v3.pdf
Summary: We recover the underlying 3D structure from images of cartoons and anime depicting the same scene. This is an interesting problem domain because images in creative media are often depicted without explicit geometric consistency for storytelling and creative expression-they are only 3D in a qualitative sense. While humans can easily perceive the underlying 3D scene from these images, existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods that assume 3D consistency fail catastrophically. We present Toon3D for reconstructing geometrically inconsistent images. Our key insight is to deform the input images while recovering camera poses and scene geometry, effectively explaining away geometrical inconsistencies to achieve consistency. This process is guided by the structure inferred from monocular depth predictions. We curate a dataset with multi-view imagery from cartoons and anime that we annotate with reliable sparse correspondences using our user-friendly annotation tool. Our recovered point clouds can be plugged into novel-view synthesis methods to experience cartoons from viewpoints never drawn before. We evaluate against classical and recent learning-based SfM methods, where Toon3D is able to obtain more reliable camera poses and scene geometry.
