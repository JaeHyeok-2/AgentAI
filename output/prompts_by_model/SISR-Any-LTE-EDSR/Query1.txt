You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I resized an old landscape photo to an exact custom size and even the leaf textures came back sharp. How does AI represent an image internally so it can restore such fine detail at any scale I choose?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Enhancing Image Matting in Real-World Scenes with Mask-Guided Iterative Refinement
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17093v1.pdf
Summary: Real-world image matting is essential for applications in content creation and augmented reality. However, it remains challenging due to the complex nature of scenes and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce Mask2Alpha, an iterative refinement framework designed to enhance semantic comprehension, instance awareness, and fine-detail recovery in image matting. Our framework leverages self-supervised Vision Transformer features as semantic priors, strengthening contextual understanding in complex scenarios. To further improve instance differentiation, we implement a mask-guided feature selection module, enabling precise targeting of objects in multi-instance settings. Additionally, a sparse convolution-based optimization scheme allows Mask2Alpha to recover high-resolution details through progressive refinement,from low-resolution semantic passes to high-resolution sparse reconstructions. Benchmarking across various real-world datasets, Mask2Alpha consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its effectiveness in accurate and efficient image matting.

Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16025v1.pdf
Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Towards flexible perception with visual memory
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08172v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/google-deepmind/visual-memory
Summary: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is nearly impossible, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in "stone" weights.
