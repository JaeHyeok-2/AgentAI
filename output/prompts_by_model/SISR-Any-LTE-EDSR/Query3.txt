Summary: Pooling layers (e.g., max and average) may overlook important information encoded in the spatial arrangement of pixel intensity and/or feature values. We propose a novel lacunarity pooling layer that aims to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the feature maps by evaluating the variability within local windows. The layer operates at multiple scales, allowing the network to adaptively learn hierarchical features. The lacunarity pooling layer can be seamlessly integrated into any artificial neural network architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the layer's effectiveness in capturing intricate spatial patterns, leading to improved feature extraction capabilities. The proposed approach holds promise in various domains, especially in agricultural image analysis tasks. This work contributes to the evolving landscape of artificial neural network architectures by introducing a novel pooling layer that enriches the representation of spatial features. Our code is publicly available.

Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Towards flexible perception with visual memory
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08172v2.pdf

Summary: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is nearly impossible, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in "stone" weights.
