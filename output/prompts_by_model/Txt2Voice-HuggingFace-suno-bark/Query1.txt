You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I noticed live captions pop up almost instantly even in a noisy subway announcement. Accents and background sounds vary a lot—how does AI recognize speech so fast and turn it into text? What extra steps keep accuracy high in that noise?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: SLAM-AAC: Enhancing Audio Captioning with Paraphrasing Augmentation and CLAP-Refine through LLMs
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09503v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/X-LANCE/SLAM-LLM
Summary: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) aims to generate natural textual descriptions for input audio signals. Recent progress in audio pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced audio understanding and textual reasoning capabilities, making improvements in AAC possible. In this paper, we propose SLAM-AAC to further enhance AAC with paraphrasing augmentation and CLAP-Refine through LLMs. Our approach uses the self-supervised EAT model to extract fine-grained audio representations, which are then aligned with textual embeddings via lightweight linear layers. The caption generation LLM is efficiently fine-tuned using the LoRA adapter. Drawing inspiration from the back-translation method in machine translation, we implement paraphrasing augmentation to expand the Clotho dataset during pre-training. This strategy helps alleviate the limitation of scarce audio-text pairs and generates more diverse captions from a small set of audio clips. During inference, we introduce the plug-and-play CLAP-Refine strategy to fully exploit multiple decoding outputs, akin to the n-best rescoring strategy in speech recognition. Using the CLAP model for audio-text similarity calculation, we could select the textual descriptions generated by multiple searching beams that best match the input audio. Experimental results show that SLAM-AAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on Clotho V2 and AudioCaps, surpassing previous mainstream models.

Model: Empowering the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community: Enhancing Video Captions Using Large Language Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00342v1.pdf
Summary: In today's digital age, video content is prevalent, serving as a primary source of information, education, and entertainment. However, the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community often faces significant challenges in accessing video content due to the inadequacy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in providing accurate and reliable captions. This paper addresses the urgent need to improve video caption quality by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). We present a comprehensive study that explores the integration of LLMs to enhance the accuracy and context-awareness of captions generated by ASR systems. Our methodology involves a novel pipeline that corrects ASR-generated captions using advanced LLMs. It explicitly focuses on models like GPT-3.5 and Llama2-13B due to their robust performance in language comprehension and generation tasks. We introduce a dataset representative of real-world challenges the DHH community faces to evaluate our proposed pipeline. Our results indicate that LLM-enhanced captions significantly improve accuracy, as evidenced by a notably lower Word Error Rate (WER) achieved by ChatGPT-3.5 (WER: 9.75%) compared to the original ASR captions (WER: 23.07%), ChatGPT-3.5 shows an approximate 57.72% improvement in WER compared to the original ASR captions.

Model: Zero-Shot Audio Captioning via Audibility Guidance
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03884v1.pdf
Summary: The task of audio captioning is similar in essence to tasks such as image and video captioning. However, it has received much less attention. We propose three desiderata for captioning audio -- (i) fluency of the generated text, (ii) faithfulness of the generated text to the input audio, and the somewhat related (iii) audibility, which is the quality of being able to be perceived based only on audio. Our method is a zero-shot method, i.e., we do not learn to perform captioning. Instead, captioning occurs as an inference process that involves three networks that correspond to the three desired qualities: (i) A Large Language Model, in our case, for reasons of convenience, GPT-2, (ii) A model that provides a matching score between an audio file and a text, for which we use a multimodal matching network called ImageBind, and (iii) A text classifier, trained using a dataset we collected automatically by instructing GPT-4 with prompts designed to direct the generation of both audible and inaudible sentences. We present our results on the AudioCap dataset, demonstrating that audibility guidance significantly enhances performance compared to the baseline, which lacks this objective.
