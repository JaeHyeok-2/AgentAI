Model: Refinement of Monocular Depth Maps via Multi-View Differentiable Rendering
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03861v1.pdf
Summary: The accurate reconstruction of per-pixel depth for an image is vital for many tasks in computer graphics, computer vision, and robotics. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate view consistent and detailed depth maps from a number of posed images. We leverage advances in monocular depth estimation, which generate topologically complete, but metrically inaccurate depth maps and refine them in a two-stage optimization process based on a differentiable renderer. Taking the monocular depth map as input, we first scale this map to absolute distances based on structure-from-motion and transform the depths to a triangle surface mesh. We then refine this depth mesh in a local optimization, enforcing photometric and geometric consistency.   Our evaluation shows that our method is able to generate dense, detailed, high-quality depth maps, also in challenging indoor scenarios, and outperforms state-of-the-art depth reconstruction approaches.

Model: Calibrating Panoramic Depth Estimation for Practical Localization and Mapping
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14005v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/82magnolia/panoramic-depth-calibration
Summary: The absolute depth values of surrounding environments provide crucial cues for various assistive technologies, such as localization, navigation, and 3D structure estimation. We propose that accurate depth estimated from panoramic images can serve as a powerful and light-weight input for a wide range of downstream tasks requiring 3D information. While panoramic images can easily capture the surrounding context from commodity devices, the estimated depth shares the limitations of conventional image-based depth estimation; the performance deteriorates under large domain shifts and the absolute values are still ambiguous to infer from 2D observations. By taking advantage of the holistic view, we mitigate such effects in a self-supervised way and fine-tune the network with geometric consistency during the test phase. Specifically, we construct a 3D point cloud from the current depth prediction and project the point cloud at various viewpoints or apply stretches on the current input image to generate synthetic panoramas. Then we minimize the discrepancy of the 3D structure estimated from synthetic images without collecting additional data. We empirically evaluate our method in robot navigation and map-free localization where our method shows large performance enhancements. Our calibration method can therefore widen the applicability under various external conditions, serving as a key component for practical panorama-based machine vision systems.

Model: IM360: Textured Mesh Reconstruction for Large-scale Indoor Mapping with 360$^\circ$ Cameras
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12545v2.pdf
Summary: We present a novel 3D reconstruction pipeline for 360$^\circ$ cameras for 3D mapping and rendering of indoor environments. Traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods may not work well in large-scale indoor scenes due to the prevalence of textureless and repetitive regions. To overcome these challenges, our approach (IM360) leverages the wide field of view of omnidirectional images and integrates the spherical camera model into every core component of the SfM pipeline. In order to develop a comprehensive 3D reconstruction solution, we integrate a neural implicit surface reconstruction technique to generate high-quality surfaces from sparse input data. Additionally, we utilize a mesh-based neural rendering approach to refine texture maps and accurately capture view-dependent properties by combining diffuse and specular components. We evaluate our pipeline on large-scale indoor scenes from the Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D datasets. In practice, IM360 demonstrate superior performance in terms of textured mesh reconstruction over SOTA. We observe accuracy improvements in terms of camera localization and registration as well as rendering high frequency details.
