Model: EvPlug: Learn a Plug-and-Play Module for Event and Image Fusion
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16933v1.pdf
Summary: Event cameras and RGB cameras exhibit complementary characteristics in imaging: the former possesses high dynamic range (HDR) and high temporal resolution, while the latter provides rich texture and color information. This makes the integration of event cameras into middle- and high-level RGB-based vision tasks highly promising. However, challenges arise in multi-modal fusion, data annotation, and model architecture design. In this paper, we propose EvPlug, which learns a plug-and-play event and image fusion module from the supervision of the existing RGB-based model. The learned fusion module integrates event streams with image features in the form of a plug-in, endowing the RGB-based model to be robust to HDR and fast motion scenes while enabling high temporal resolution inference. Our method only requires unlabeled event-image pairs (no pixel-wise alignment required) and does not alter the structure or weights of the RGB-based model. We demonstrate the superiority of EvPlug in several vision tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D hand pose estimation

Model: An abstract theory of sensor eventification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00563v1.pdf
Summary: Unlike traditional cameras, event cameras measure changes in light intensity and report differences. This paper examines the conditions necessary for other traditional sensors to admit eventified versions that provide adequate information despite outputting only changes. The requirements depend upon the regularity of the signal space, which we show may depend on several factors including structure arising from the interplay of the robot and its environment, the input-output computation needed to achieve its task, as well as the specific mode of access (synchronous, asynchronous, polled, triggered). Further, there are additional properties of stability (or non-oscillatory behavior) that can be desirable for a system to possess and that we show are also closely related to the preceding notions. This paper contributes theory and algorithms (plus a hardness result) that addresses these considerations while developing several elementary robot examples along the way.

Model: Breaking Modality Disparity: Harmonized Representation for Infrared and Visible Image Registration
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05646v2.pdf
Summary: Since the differences in viewing range, resolution and relative position, the multi-modality sensing module composed of infrared and visible cameras needs to be registered so as to have more accurate scene perception. In practice, manual calibration-based registration is the most widely used process, and it is regularly calibrated to maintain accuracy, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To cope with these problems, we propose a scene-adaptive infrared and visible image registration. Specifically, in regard of the discrepancy between multi-modality images, an invertible translation process is developed to establish a modality-invariant domain, which comprehensively embraces the feature intensity and distribution of both infrared and visible modalities. We employ homography to simulate the deformation between different planes and develop a hierarchical framework to rectify the deformation inferred from the proposed latent representation in a coarse-to-fine manner. For that, the advanced perception ability coupled with the residual estimation conducive to the regression of sparse offsets, and the alternate correlation search facilitates a more accurate correspondence matching. Moreover, we propose the first ground truth available misaligned infrared and visible image dataset, involving three synthetic sets and one real-world set. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method against the state-of-the-arts, advancing the subsequent applications.
