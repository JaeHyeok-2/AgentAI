Summary: Image matching that finding robust and accurate correspondences across images is a challenging task under extreme conditions. Capturing local and global features simultaneously is an important way to mitigate such an issue but recent transformer-based decoders were still stuck in the issues that CNN-based encoders only extract local features and the transformers lack locality. Inspired by the locality and implicit positional encoding of convolutions, a novel convolutional transformer is proposed to capture both local contexts and global structures more sufficiently for detector-free matching. Firstly, a universal FPN-like framework captures global structures in self-encoder as well as cross-decoder by transformers and compensates local contexts as well as implicit positional encoding by convolutions. Secondly, a novel convolutional transformer module explores multi-scale long range dependencies by a novel multi-scale attention and further aggregates local information inside dependencies for enhancing locality. Finally, a novel regression-based sub-pixel refinement module exploits the whole fine-grained window features for fine-level positional deviation regression. The proposed method achieves superior performances on a wide range of benchmarks. The code will be available on https://github.com/zwh0527/LGFCTR.

Summary: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from two-dimensional images is an active research field in computer vision, with applications ranging from navigation and object tracking to segmentation and three-dimensional modeling. Traditionally, parametric techniques have been employed for this task. However, recent advancements have seen a shift towards learning-based methods. Given the rapid pace of research and the frequent introduction of new image matching methods, it is essential to evaluate them. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various image matching methods using a structure-from-motion pipeline. We assess the performance of these methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, identifying key limitations in both the methods and benchmarks. We also investigate the impact of edge detection as a pre-processing step. Our analysis reveals that image matching for 3D reconstruction remains an open challenge, necessitating careful selection and tuning of models for specific scenarios, while also highlighting mismatches in how metrics currently represent method performance.
