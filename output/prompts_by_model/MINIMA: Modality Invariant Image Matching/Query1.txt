Model: MATCHA:Towards Matching Anything
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14945v1.pdf
Summary: Establishing correspondences across images is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, underpinning tasks like Structure-from-Motion, image editing, and point tracking. Traditional methods are often specialized for specific correspondence types, geometric, semantic, or temporal, whereas humans naturally identify alignments across these domains. Inspired by this flexibility, we propose MATCHA, a unified feature model designed to ``rule them all'', establishing robust correspondences across diverse matching tasks. Building on insights that diffusion model features can encode multiple correspondence types, MATCHA augments this capacity by dynamically fusing high-level semantic and low-level geometric features through an attention-based module, creating expressive, versatile, and robust features. Additionally, MATCHA integrates object-level features from DINOv2 to further boost generalization, enabling a single feature capable of matching anything. Extensive experiments validate that MATCHA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across geometric, semantic, and temporal matching tasks, setting a new foundation for a unified approach for the fundamental correspondence problem in computer vision. To the best of our knowledge, MATCHA is the first approach that is able to effectively tackle diverse matching tasks with a single unified feature.

Model: Breaking Modality Disparity: Harmonized Representation for Infrared and Visible Image Registration
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05646v2.pdf
Summary: Since the differences in viewing range, resolution and relative position, the multi-modality sensing module composed of infrared and visible cameras needs to be registered so as to have more accurate scene perception. In practice, manual calibration-based registration is the most widely used process, and it is regularly calibrated to maintain accuracy, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To cope with these problems, we propose a scene-adaptive infrared and visible image registration. Specifically, in regard of the discrepancy between multi-modality images, an invertible translation process is developed to establish a modality-invariant domain, which comprehensively embraces the feature intensity and distribution of both infrared and visible modalities. We employ homography to simulate the deformation between different planes and develop a hierarchical framework to rectify the deformation inferred from the proposed latent representation in a coarse-to-fine manner. For that, the advanced perception ability coupled with the residual estimation conducive to the regression of sparse offsets, and the alternate correlation search facilitates a more accurate correspondence matching. Moreover, we propose the first ground truth available misaligned infrared and visible image dataset, involving three synthetic sets and one real-world set. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method against the state-of-the-arts, advancing the subsequent applications.

Model: Matching Non-Identical Objects
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08227v3.pdf
Summary: Not identical but similar objects are ubiquitous in our world, ranging from four-legged animals such as dogs and cats to cars of different models and flowers of various colors. This study addresses a novel task of matching such non-identical objects at the pixel level. We propose a weighting scheme of descriptors that incorporates semantic information from object detectors into existing sparse image matching methods, extending their targets from identical objects captured from different perspectives to semantically similar objects. The experiments show successful matching between non-identical objects in various cases, including in-class design variations, class discrepancy, and domain shifts (e.g., photo--drawing and image corruptions).
