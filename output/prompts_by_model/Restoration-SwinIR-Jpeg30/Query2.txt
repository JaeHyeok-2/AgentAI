Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: SPAC-Net: Rethinking Point Cloud Completion with Structural Prior
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15066v1.pdf

Summary: Point cloud completion aims to infer a complete shape from its partial observation. Many approaches utilize a pure encoderdecoder paradigm in which complete shape can be directly predicted by shape priors learned from partial scans, however, these methods suffer from the loss of details inevitably due to the feature abstraction issues. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,termed SPAC-Net, that aims to rethink the completion task under the guidance of a new structural prior, we call it interface. Specifically, our method first investigates Marginal Detector (MAD) module to localize the interface, defined as the intersection between the known observation and the missing parts. Based on the interface, our method predicts the coarse shape by learning the displacement from the points in interface move to their corresponding position in missing parts. Furthermore, we devise an additional Structure Supplement(SSP) module before the upsampling stage to enhance the structural details of the coarse shape, enabling the upsampling module to focus more on the upsampling task. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several challenging benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Model: LDA-AQU: Adaptive Query-guided Upsampling via Local Deformable Attention
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19585v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/duzw9311/lda-aqu
Summary: Feature upsampling is an essential operation in constructing deep convolutional neural networks. However, existing upsamplers either lack specific feature guidance or necessitate the utilization of high-resolution feature maps, resulting in a loss of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we find that the local self-attention naturally has the feature guidance capability, and its computational paradigm aligns closely with the essence of feature upsampling (\ie feature reassembly of neighboring points). Therefore, we introduce local self-attention into the upsampling task and demonstrate that the majority of existing upsamplers can be regarded as special cases of upsamplers based on local self-attention. Considering the potential semantic gap between upsampled points and their neighboring points, we further introduce the deformation mechanism into the upsampler based on local self-attention, thereby proposing LDA-AQU. As a novel dynamic kernel-based upsampler, LDA-AQU utilizes the feature of queries to guide the model in adaptively adjusting the position and aggregation weight of neighboring points, thereby meeting the upsampling requirements across various complex scenarios. In addition, LDA-AQU is lightweight and can be easily integrated into various model architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of LDA-AQU across four dense prediction tasks: object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and semantic segmentation. LDA-AQU consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art upsamplers, achieving performance enhancements of 1.7 AP, 1.5 AP, 2.0 PQ, and 2.5 mIoU compared to the baseline models in the aforementioned four tasks, respectively.
