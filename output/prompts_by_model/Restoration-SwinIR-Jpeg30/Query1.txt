Summary: In the ever-evolving field of Artificial Intelligence, a critical challenge has been to decipher the decision-making processes within the so-called "black boxes" in deep learning. Over recent years, a plethora of methods have emerged, dedicated to explaining decisions across diverse tasks. Particularly in tasks like image classification, these methods typically identify and emphasize the pivotal pixels that most influence a classifier's prediction. Interestingly, this approach mirrors human behavior: when asked to explain our rationale for classifying an image, we often point to the most salient features or aspects. Capitalizing on this parallel, our research embarked on a user-centric study. We sought to objectively measure the interpretability of three leading explanation methods: (1) Prototypical Part Network, (2) Occlusion, and (3) Layer-wise Relevance Propagation. Intriguingly, our results highlight that while the regions spotlighted by these methods can vary widely, they all offer humans a nearly equivalent depth of understanding. This enables users to discern and categorize images efficiently, reinforcing the value of these methods in enhancing AI transparency.

Model: Towards flexible perception with visual memory

Summary: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is nearly impossible, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in "stone" weights.

Model: ImageNet-Hard: The Hardest Images Remaining from a Study of the Power of Zoom and Spatial Biases in Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05538v4.pdf
Summary: Image classifiers are information-discarding machines, by design. Yet, how these models discard information remains mysterious. We hypothesize that one way for image classifiers to reach high accuracy is to first zoom to the most discriminative region in the image and then extract features from there to predict image labels, discarding the rest of the image. Studying six popular networks ranging from AlexNet to CLIP, we find that proper framing of the input image can lead to the correct classification of 98.91% of ImageNet images. Furthermore, we uncover positional biases in various datasets, especially a strong center bias in two popular datasets: ImageNet-A and ObjectNet. Finally, leveraging our insights into the potential of zooming, we propose a test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions. Our method is more interpretable, accurate, and faster than MEMO, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTA method. We introduce ImageNet-Hard, a new benchmark that challenges SOTA classifiers including large vision-language models even when optimal zooming is allowed.
