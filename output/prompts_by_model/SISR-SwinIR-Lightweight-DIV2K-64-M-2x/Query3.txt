Model: Enhancing Performance of Explainable AI Models with Constrained Concept Refinement
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06775v1.pdf
Summary: The trade-off between accuracy and interpretability has long been a challenge in machine learning (ML). This tension is particularly significant for emerging interpretable-by-design methods, which aim to redesign ML algorithms for trustworthy interpretability but often sacrifice accuracy in the process. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating the impact of deviations in concept representations-an essential component of interpretable models-on prediction performance and propose a novel framework to mitigate these effects. The framework builds on the principle of optimizing concept embeddings under constraints that preserve interpretability. Using a generative model as a test-bed, we rigorously prove that our algorithm achieves zero loss while progressively enhancing the interpretability of the resulting model. Additionally, we evaluate the practical performance of our proposed framework in generating explainable predictions for image classification tasks across various benchmarks. Compared to existing explainable methods, our approach not only improves prediction accuracy while preserving model interpretability across various large-scale benchmarks but also achieves this with significantly lower computational cost.

Model: The Simpler The Better: An Entropy-Based Importance Metric To Reduce Neural Networks' Depth

Summary: While deep neural networks are highly effective at solving complex tasks, large pre-trained models are commonly employed even to solve consistently simpler downstream tasks, which do not necessarily require a large model's complexity. Motivated by the awareness of the ever-growing AI environmental impact, we propose an efficiency strategy that leverages prior knowledge transferred by large models. Simple but effective, we propose a method relying on an Entropy-bASed Importance mEtRic (EASIER) to reduce the depth of over-parametrized deep neural networks, which alleviates their computational burden. We assess the effectiveness of our method on traditional image classification setups. Our code is available at https://github.com/VGCQ/EASIER.

Model: Unveiling Reasoning Thresholds in Language Models: Scaling, Fine-Tuning, and Interpretability through Attention Maps
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15120v1.pdf
Summary: This study investigates the in-context learning capabilities of various decoder-only transformer-based language models with different model sizes and training data, including GPT2, SmolLM2, OpenELM, TinyLlama, Stable LM, and Gemma 2. We identify a critical parameter threshold (~1.6 billion), beyond which reasoning performance improves significantly in tasks such as commonsense reasoning in multiple-choice question answering and deductive reasoning. Specifically, models above this threshold achieve better success rates in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for deductive reasoning tasks, especially those requiring longer reasoning chains, such as proof by contradiction and disjunction elimination. To address limitations in sub-threshold models, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with task-specific exemplars substantially enhances reasoning performance, enabling accurate CoT generation even without additional exemplars in the prompt for tasks with shorter reasoning chains. Finally, our analysis of attention maps reveals that models capable of generating correct CoTs exhibit higher token-level attention scores on subsequent correct tokens and the correct parts of speech, providing interpretability insights into reasoning processes. These findings collectively advance understanding of reasoning capabilities in decoder-only transformer-based models.
