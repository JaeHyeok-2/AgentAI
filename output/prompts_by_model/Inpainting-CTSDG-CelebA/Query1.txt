Model: FaceCom: Towards High-fidelity 3D Facial Shape Completion via Optimization and Inpainting Guidance
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02074v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/dragonylee/facecom
Summary: We propose FaceCom, a method for 3D facial shape completion, which delivers high-fidelity results for incomplete facial inputs of arbitrary forms. Unlike end-to-end shape completion methods based on point clouds or voxels, our approach relies on a mesh-based generative network that is easy to optimize, enabling it to handle shape completion for irregular facial scans. We first train a shape generator on a mixed 3D facial dataset containing 2405 identities. Based on the incomplete facial input, we fit complete faces using an optimization approach under image inpainting guidance. The completion results are refined through a post-processing step. FaceCom demonstrates the ability to effectively and naturally complete facial scan data with varying missing regions and degrees of missing areas. Our method can be used in medical prosthetic fabrication and the registration of deficient scanning data. Our experimental results demonstrate that FaceCom achieves exceptional performance in fitting and shape completion tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/dragonylee/FaceCom.git.

Model: Blind Inpainting with Object-aware Discrimination for Artificial Marker Removal
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15124v2.pdf
Summary: Medical images often incorporate doctor-added markers that can hinder AI-based diagnosis. This issue highlights the need of inpainting techniques to restore the corrupted visual contents. However, existing methods require manual mask annotation as input, limiting the application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel blind inpainting method that automatically reconstructs visual contents within the corrupted regions without mask input as guidance. Our model includes a blind reconstruction network and an object-aware discriminator for adversarial training. The reconstruction network contains two branches that predict corrupted regions in images and simultaneously restore the missing visual contents. Leveraging the potent recognition capability of a dense object detector, the object-aware discriminator ensures markers undetectable after inpainting. Thus, the restored images closely resemble the clean ones. We evaluate our method on three datasets of various medical imaging modalities, confirming better performance over other state-of-the-art methods.

Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06657v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/felixcheng97/agap
Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.
