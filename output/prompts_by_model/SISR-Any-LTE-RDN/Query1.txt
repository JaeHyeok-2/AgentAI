You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I upscaled a magazine scan about 5.7× and the print dots vanished while the ink look stayed. How does AI handle frequency information to stay natural at odd scaling factors like that?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Elastic-DETR: Making Image Resolution Learnable with Content-Specific Network Prediction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06341v1.pdf
Summary: Multi-scale image resolution is a de facto standard approach in modern object detectors, such as DETR. This technique allows for the acquisition of various scale information from multiple image resolutions. However, manual hyperparameter selection of the resolution can restrict its flexibility, which is informed by prior knowledge, necessitating human intervention. This work introduces a novel strategy for learnable resolution, called Elastic-DETR, enabling elastic utilization of multiple image resolutions. Our network provides an adaptive scale factor based on the content of the image with a compact scale prediction module (< 2 GFLOPs). The key aspect of our method lies in how to determine the resolution without prior knowledge. We present two loss functions derived from identified key components for resolution optimization: scale loss, which increases adaptiveness according to the image, and distribution loss, which determines the overall degree of scaling based on network performance. By leveraging the resolution's flexibility, we can demonstrate various models that exhibit varying trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity. We empirically show that our scheme can unleash the potential of a wide spectrum of image resolutions without constraining flexibility. Our models on MS COCO establish a maximum accuracy gain of 3.5%p or 26% decrease in computation than MS-trained DN-DETR.

Model: FontDiffuser: One-Shot Font Generation via Denoising Diffusion with Multi-Scale Content Aggregation and Style Contrastive Learning
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12142v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/yeungchenwa/fontdiffuser
Summary: Automatic font generation is an imitation task, which aims to create a font library that mimics the style of reference images while preserving the content from source images. Although existing font generation methods have achieved satisfactory performance, they still struggle with complex characters and large style variations. To address these issues, we propose FontDiffuser, a diffusion-based image-to-image one-shot font generation method, which innovatively models the font imitation task as a noise-to-denoise paradigm. In our method, we introduce a Multi-scale Content Aggregation (MCA) block, which effectively combines global and local content cues across different scales, leading to enhanced preservation of intricate strokes of complex characters. Moreover, to better manage the large variations in style transfer, we propose a Style Contrastive Refinement (SCR) module, which is a novel structure for style representation learning. It utilizes a style extractor to disentangle styles from images, subsequently supervising the diffusion model via a meticulously designed style contrastive loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate FontDiffuser's state-of-the-art performance in generating diverse characters and styles. It consistently excels on complex characters and large style changes compared to previous methods. The code is available at https://github.com/yeungchenwa/FontDiffuser.
