Model: SQLdepth: Generalizable Self-Supervised Fine-Structured Monocular Depth Estimation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00526v1.pdf
Summary: Recently, self-supervised monocular depth estimation has gained popularity with numerous applications in autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing solutions primarily seek to estimate depth from immediate visual features, and struggle to recover fine-grained scene details with limited generalization. In this paper, we introduce SQLdepth, a novel approach that can effectively learn fine-grained scene structures from motion. In SQLdepth, we propose a novel Self Query Layer (SQL) to build a self-cost volume and infer depth from it, rather than inferring depth from feature maps. The self-cost volume implicitly captures the intrinsic geometry of the scene within a single frame. Each individual slice of the volume signifies the relative distances between points and objects within a latent space. Ultimately, this volume is compressed to the depth map via a novel decoding approach. Experimental results on KITTI and Cityscapes show that our method attains remarkable state-of-the-art performance (AbsRel = $0.082$ on KITTI, $0.052$ on KITTI with improved ground-truth and $0.106$ on Cityscapes), achieves $9.9\%$, $5.5\%$ and $4.5\%$ error reduction from the previous best. In addition, our approach showcases reduced training complexity, computational efficiency, improved generalization, and the ability to recover fine-grained scene details. Moreover, the self-supervised pre-trained and metric fine-tuned SQLdepth can surpass existing supervised methods by significant margins (AbsRel = $0.043$, $14\%$ error reduction). self-matching-oriented relative distance querying in SQL improves the robustness and zero-shot generalization capability of SQLdepth. Code and the pre-trained weights will be publicly available. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/hisfog/SQLdepth-Impl}{https://github.com/hisfog/SQLdepth-Impl}.

Model: Foundation Models Meet Low-Cost Sensors: Test-Time Adaptation for Rescaling Disparity for Zero-Shot Metric Depth Estimation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14103v1.pdf
Summary: The recent development of foundation models for monocular depth estimation such as Depth Anything paved the way to zero-shot monocular depth estimation. Since it returns an affine-invariant disparity map, the favored technique to recover the metric depth consists in fine-tuning the model. However, this stage is not straightforward, it can be costly and time-consuming because of the training and the creation of the dataset. The latter must contain images captured by the camera that will be used at test time and the corresponding ground truth. Moreover, the fine-tuning may also degrade the generalizing capacity of the original model. Instead, we propose in this paper a new method to rescale Depth Anything predictions using 3D points provided by sensors or techniques such as low-resolution LiDAR or structure-from-motion with poses given by an IMU. This approach avoids fine-tuning and preserves the generalizing power of the original depth estimation model while being robust to the noise of the sparse depth or of the depth model. Our experiments highlight enhancements relative to zero-shot monocular metric depth estimation methods, competitive results compared to fine-tuned approaches and a better robustness than depth completion approaches.

Model: Calibrating Panoramic Depth Estimation for Practical Localization and Mapping
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14005v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/82magnolia/panoramic-depth-calibration
Summary: The absolute depth values of surrounding environments provide crucial cues for various assistive technologies, such as localization, navigation, and 3D structure estimation. We propose that accurate depth estimated from panoramic images can serve as a powerful and light-weight input for a wide range of downstream tasks requiring 3D information. While panoramic images can easily capture the surrounding context from commodity devices, the estimated depth shares the limitations of conventional image-based depth estimation; the performance deteriorates under large domain shifts and the absolute values are still ambiguous to infer from 2D observations. By taking advantage of the holistic view, we mitigate such effects in a self-supervised way and fine-tune the network with geometric consistency during the test phase. Specifically, we construct a 3D point cloud from the current depth prediction and project the point cloud at various viewpoints or apply stretches on the current input image to generate synthetic panoramas. Then we minimize the discrepancy of the 3D structure estimated from synthetic images without collecting additional data. We empirically evaluate our method in robot navigation and map-free localization where our method shows large performance enhancements. Our calibration method can therefore widen the applicability under various external conditions, serving as a key component for practical panorama-based machine vision systems.
