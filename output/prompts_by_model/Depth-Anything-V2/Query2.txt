Summary: This paper presents an advanced mapping system that combines drone imagery with machine learning and computer vision to overcome challenges in speed, accuracy, and adaptability across diverse terrains. By automating processes like feature detection, image matching, and stitching, the system produces seamless, high-resolution maps with minimal latency, offering strategic advantages in defense operations. Developed in Python, the system utilizes OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for efficient computations, and Concurrent[dot]futures for parallel execution. ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) is employed for feature detection, while FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) ensures accurate keypoint matching. Homography transformations align overlapping images, resulting in distortion-free maps in real time. This automation eliminates manual intervention, enabling live updates essential in rapidly changing environments. Designed for versatility, the system performs reliably under various lighting conditions and rugged terrains, making it highly suitable for aerospace and defense applications. Testing has shown notable improvements in processing speed and accuracy compared to conventional methods, enhancing situational awareness and informed decision-making. This scalable solution leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide actionable, reliable data for mission-critical operations.

Model: Stereo4D: Learning How Things Move in 3D from Internet Stereo Videos
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09621v1.pdf
Summary: Learning to understand dynamic 3D scenes from imagery is crucial for applications ranging from robotics to scene reconstruction. Yet, unlike other problems where large-scale supervised training has enabled rapid progress, directly supervising methods for recovering 3D motion remains challenging due to the fundamental difficulty of obtaining ground truth annotations. We present a system for mining high-quality 4D reconstructions from internet stereoscopic, wide-angle videos. Our system fuses and filters the outputs of camera pose estimation, stereo depth estimation, and temporal tracking methods into high-quality dynamic 3D reconstructions. We use this method to generate large-scale data in the form of world-consistent, pseudo-metric 3D point clouds with long-term motion trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of this data by training a variant of DUSt3R to predict structure and 3D motion from real-world image pairs, showing that training on our reconstructed data enables generalization to diverse real-world scenes.
