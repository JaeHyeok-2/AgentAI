You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I saw the AI connect joints instantly even when people crossed paths in the video. How does it keep each skeleton separate and accurate with so much overlap?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

Model: How Object Information Improves Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition in Assembly Tasks
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05844v1.pdf
Summary: As the use of collaborative robots (cobots) in industrial manufacturing continues to grow, human action recognition for effective human-robot collaboration becomes increasingly important. This ability is crucial for cobots to act autonomously and assist in assembly tasks. Recently, skeleton-based approaches are often used as they tend to generalize better to different people and environments. However, when processing skeletons alone, information about the objects a human interacts with is lost. Therefore, we present a novel approach of integrating object information into skeleton-based action recognition. We enhance two state-of-the-art methods by treating object centers as further skeleton joints. Our experiments on the assembly dataset IKEA ASM show that our approach improves the performance of these state-of-the-art methods to a large extent when combining skeleton joints with objects predicted by a state-of-the-art instance segmentation model. Our research sheds light on the benefits of combining skeleton joints with object information for human action recognition in assembly tasks. We analyze the effect of the object detector on the combination for action classification and discuss the important factors that must be taken into account.

Model: Building Rearticulable Models for Arbitrary 3D Objects from 4D Point Clouds
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00979v1.pdf

Summary: We build rearticulable models for arbitrary everyday man-made objects containing an arbitrary number of parts that are connected together in arbitrary ways via 1 degree-of-freedom joints. Given point cloud videos of such everyday objects, our method identifies the distinct object parts, what parts are connected to what other parts, and the properties of the joints connecting each part pair. We do this by jointly optimizing the part segmentation, transformation, and kinematics using a novel energy minimization framework. Our inferred animatable models, enables retargeting to novel poses with sparse point correspondences guidance. We test our method on a new articulating robot dataset, and the Sapiens dataset with common daily objects, as well as real-world scans. Experiments show that our method outperforms two leading prior works on various metrics.

Model: Hi4D: 4D Instance Segmentation of Close Human Interaction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15380v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/yifeiyin04/Hi4D
Summary: We propose Hi4D, a method and dataset for the automatic analysis of physically close human-human interaction under prolonged contact. Robustly disentangling several in-contact subjects is a challenging task due to occlusions and complex shapes. Hence, existing multi-view systems typically fuse 3D surfaces of close subjects into a single, connected mesh. To address this issue we leverage i) individually fitted neural implicit avatars; ii) an alternating optimization scheme that refines pose and surface through periods of close proximity; and iii) thus segment the fused raw scans into individual instances. From these instances we compile Hi4D dataset of 4D textured scans of 20 subject pairs, 100 sequences, and a total of more than 11K frames. Hi4D contains rich interaction-centric annotations in 2D and 3D alongside accurately registered parametric body models. We define varied human pose and shape estimation tasks on this dataset and provide results from state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks.
