Model: Super-Resolution Microscopy Based on the Inherent Fluctuations of Dye Molecules
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00261v2.pdf
Summary: Fluorescence microscopy is a critical tool across various disciplines, from materials science to biomedical research, yet it is limited by the diffraction limit of resolution. Advanced super-resolution techniques such as localization microscopy and stimulated-emission-depletion microscopy often demand considerable resources. These methods depend heavily on elaborate sample-staining, complex optical systems, or prolonged acquisition periods, and their application in 3D and multicolor imaging presents significant experimental challenges. In the current work, we provide a complete demonstration of a widely accessible super-resolution imaging approach capable of 3D and multicolor imaging. We replace the confocal pinhole with an array of single-photon avalanche diodes and use the microsecond-scale fluctuations of dye molecules as a contrast mechanism. This contrast is transformed into a super-resolved image using a robust and deterministic algorithm. Our technique utilizes natural fluctuations inherent to organic dyes, thereby it does not require engineering of the blinking statistics. Our robust, versatile super-resolution method opens the way to next-generation multimodal imaging and facilitates on-demand super-resolution within a confocal architecture.

Model: A Study in Dataset Distillation for Image Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03656v1.pdf
Summary: Dataset distillation is the concept of condensing large datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While previous research has primarily focused on image classification, its application to image Super-Resolution (SR) remains underexplored. This exploratory work studies multiple dataset distillation techniques applied to SR, including pixel- and latent-space approaches under different aspects. Our experiments demonstrate that a 91.12% dataset size reduction can be achieved while maintaining comparable SR performance to the full dataset. We further analyze initialization strategies and distillation methods to optimize memory efficiency and computational costs. Our findings provide new insights into dataset distillation for SR and set the stage for future advancements.

Model: FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16025v1.pdf
Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.
