Model: Personalized Top-k Set Queries Over Predicted Scores
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12998v1.pdf
Summary: This work studies the applicability of expensive external oracles such as large language models in answering top-k queries over predicted scores. Such scores are incurred by user-defined functions to answer personalized queries over multi-modal data. We propose a generic computational framework that handles arbitrary set-based scoring functions, as long as the functions could be decomposed into constructs, each of which sent to an oracle (in our case an LLM) to predict partial scores. At a given point in time, the framework assumes a set of responses and their partial predicted scores, and it maintains a collection of possible sets that are likely to be the true top-k. Since calling oracles is costly, our framework judiciously identifies the next construct, i.e., the next best question to ask the oracle so as to maximize the likelihood of identifying the true top-k. We present a principled probabilistic model that quantifies that likelihood. We study efficiency opportunities in designing algorithms. We run an evaluation with three large scale datasets, scoring functions, and baselines. Experiments indicate the efficacy of our framework, as it achieves an order of magnitude improvement over baselines in requiring LLM calls while ensuring result accuracy. Scalability experiments further indicate that our framework could be used in large-scale applications.

Model: Conversational Question Answering with Reformulations over Knowledge Graph
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17269v2.pdf
Summary: Conversational question answering (convQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) involves answering multi-turn natural language questions about information contained in a KG. State-of-the-art methods of ConvQA often struggle with inexplicit question-answer pairs. These inputs are easy for human beings to understand given a conversation history, but hard for a machine to interpret, which can degrade ConvQA performance. To address this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based model, CornNet, which utilizes question reformulations generated by large language models (LLMs) to improve ConvQA performance. CornNet adopts a teacher-student architecture where a teacher model learns question representations using human writing reformulations, and a student model to mimic the teacher model's output via reformulations generated by LLMs. The learned question representation is then used by an RL model to locate the correct answer in a KG. Extensive experimental results show that CornNet outperforms state-of-the-art convQA models.

Model: Learned Graph Rewriting with Equality Saturation: A New Paradigm in Relational Query Rewrite and Beyond
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12794v1.pdf
Summary: Query rewrite systems perform graph substitutions using rewrite rules to generate optimal SQL query plans. Rewriting logical and physical relational query plans is proven to be an NP-hard sequential decision-making problem with a search space exponential in the number of rewrite rules. In this paper, we address the query rewrite problem by interleaving Equality Saturation and Graph Reinforcement Learning (RL). The proposed system, Aurora, rewrites relational queries by guiding Equality Saturation, a method from compiler literature to perform non-destructive graph rewriting, with a novel RL agent that embeds both the spatial structure of the query graph as well as the temporal dimension associated with the sequential construction of query plans. Our results show Graph Reinforcement Learning for non-destructive graph rewriting yields SQL plans orders of magnitude faster than existing equality saturation solvers, while also achieving competitive results against mainstream query optimisers.
