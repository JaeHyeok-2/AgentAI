You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"Tested it across topics—from finance to medicine—and it handled them all smoothly. How can a single model adapt across such diverse domains?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Summary: Rapid advancements over the years have helped machine learning models reach previously hard-to-achieve goals, sometimes even exceeding human capabilities. However, to attain the desired accuracy, the model sizes and in turn their computational requirements have increased drastically. Thus, serving predictions from these models to meet any target latency and cost requirements of applications remains a key challenge, despite recent work in building inference-serving systems as well as algorithmic approaches that dynamically adapt models based on inputs. In this paper, we introduce a form of dynamism, modality selection, where we adaptively choose modalities from inference inputs while maintaining the model quality. We introduce MOSEL, an automated inference serving system for multi-modal ML models that carefully picks input modalities per request based on user-defined performance and accuracy requirements. MOSEL exploits modality configurations extensively, improving system throughput by 3.6$\times$ with an accuracy guarantee and shortening job completion times by 11$\times$.
