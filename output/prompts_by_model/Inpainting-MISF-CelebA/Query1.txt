A user has asked the following question:
"I removed a blotch from a face photo, and the skin looked completely natural again. How does AI know how to reconstruct both the skin’s texture and the facial shape?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

Summary: Deep Learning approaches in dermatological image classification have shown promising results, yet the field faces significant methodological challenges that impede proper evaluation. This paper presents a dual contribution: first, a systematic analysis of current methodological practices in skin disease classification research, revealing substantial inconsistencies in data preparation, augmentation strategies, and performance reporting; second, a comprehensive training and evaluation framework demonstrated through experiments with the DINOv2-Large vision transformer across three benchmark datasets (HAM10000, DermNet, ISIC Atlas). The analysis identifies concerning patterns, including pre-split data augmentation and validation-based reporting, potentially leading to overestimated metrics, while highlighting the lack of unified methodology standards. The experimental results demonstrate DINOv2's performance in skin disease classification, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.85 (HAM10000), 0.71 (DermNet), and 0.84 (ISIC Atlas). Attention map analysis reveals critical patterns in the model's decision-making, showing sophisticated feature recognition in typical presentations but significant vulnerabilities with atypical cases and composite images. Our findings highlight the need for standardized evaluation protocols and careful implementation strategies in clinical settings. We propose comprehensive methodological recommendations for model development, evaluation, and clinical deployment, emphasizing rigorous data preparation, systematic error analysis, and specialized protocols for different image types. To promote reproducibility, we provide our implementation code through GitHub. This work establishes a foundation for rigorous evaluation standards in dermatological image classification and provides insights for responsible AI implementation in clinical dermatology.

Model: FaceCom: Towards High-fidelity 3D Facial Shape Completion via Optimization and Inpainting Guidance
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02074v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/dragonylee/facecom
Summary: We propose FaceCom, a method for 3D facial shape completion, which delivers high-fidelity results for incomplete facial inputs of arbitrary forms. Unlike end-to-end shape completion methods based on point clouds or voxels, our approach relies on a mesh-based generative network that is easy to optimize, enabling it to handle shape completion for irregular facial scans. We first train a shape generator on a mixed 3D facial dataset containing 2405 identities. Based on the incomplete facial input, we fit complete faces using an optimization approach under image inpainting guidance. The completion results are refined through a post-processing step. FaceCom demonstrates the ability to effectively and naturally complete facial scan data with varying missing regions and degrees of missing areas. Our method can be used in medical prosthetic fabrication and the registration of deficient scanning data. Our experimental results demonstrate that FaceCom achieves exceptional performance in fitting and shape completion tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/dragonylee/FaceCom.git.

Model: From Transparent to Opaque: Rethinking Neural Implicit Surfaces with $α$-NeuS
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05362v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/728388808/alpha-neus
Summary: Traditional 3D shape reconstruction techniques from multi-view images, such as structure from motion and multi-view stereo, face challenges in reconstructing transparent objects. Recent advances in neural radiance fields and its variants primarily address opaque or transparent objects, encountering difficulties to reconstruct both transparent and opaque objects simultaneously. This paper introduces $\alpha$-Neus -- an extension of NeuS -- that proves NeuS is unbiased for materials from fully transparent to fully opaque. We find that transparent and opaque surfaces align with the non-negative local minima and the zero iso-surface, respectively, in the learned distance field of NeuS. Traditional iso-surfacing extraction algorithms, such as marching cubes, which rely on fixed iso-values, are ill-suited for such data. We develop a method to extract the transparent and opaque surface simultaneously based on DCUDF. To validate our approach, we construct a benchmark that includes both real-world and synthetic scenes, demonstrating its practical utility and effectiveness. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/728388808/alpha-NeuS.
