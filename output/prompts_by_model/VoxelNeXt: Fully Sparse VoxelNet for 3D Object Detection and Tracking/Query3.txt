Model: Generalizability Under Sensor Failure: Tokenization + Transformers Enable More Robust Latent Spaces
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18546v3.pdf
Summary: A major goal in neuroscience is to discover neural data representations that generalize. This goal is challenged by variability along recording sessions (e.g. environment), subjects (e.g. varying neural structures), and sensors (e.g. sensor noise), among others. Recent work has begun to address generalization across sessions and subjects, but few study robustness to sensor failure which is highly prevalent in neuroscience experiments. In order to address these generalizability dimensions we first collect our own electroencephalography dataset with numerous sessions, subjects, and sensors, then study two time series models: EEGNet (Lawhern et al., 2018) and TOTEM (Talukder et al., 2024). EEGNet is a widely used convolutional neural network, while TOTEM is a discrete time series tokenizer and transformer model. We find that TOTEM outperforms or matches EEGNet across all generalizability cases. Finally through analysis of TOTEM's latent codebook we observe that tokenization enables generalization.

Model: Narrowing the Focus: Learned Optimizers for Pretrained Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09310v3.pdf
Summary: In modern deep learning, the models are learned by applying gradient updates using an optimizer, which transforms the updates based on various statistics. Optimizers are often hand-designed and tuning their hyperparameters is a big part of the training process. Learned optimizers have shown some initial promise, but are generally unsuccessful as a general optimization mechanism applicable to every problem. In this work we explore a different direction: instead of learning general optimizers, we instead specialize them to a specific training environment. We propose a novel optimizer technique that learns a layer-specific linear combination of update directions provided by a set of base optimizers, effectively adapting its strategy to the specific model and dataset. When evaluated on image classification tasks, this specialized optimizer significantly outperforms both traditional off-the-shelf methods such as Adam, as well as existing general learned optimizers. Moreover, it demonstrates robust generalization with respect to model initialization, evaluating on unseen datasets, and training durations beyond its meta-training horizon.

Model: MATEY: multiscale adaptive foundation models for spatiotemporal physical systems
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20601v1.pdf
Summary: Accurate representation of the multiscale features in spatiotemporal physical systems using vision transformer (ViT) architectures requires extremely long, computationally prohibitive token sequences. To address this issue, we propose two adaptive tokenization schemes that dynamically adjust patch sizes based on local features: one ensures convergent behavior to uniform patch refinement, while the other offers better computational efficiency. Moreover, we present a set of spatiotemporal attention schemes, where the temporal or axial spatial dimensions are decoupled, and evaluate their computational and data efficiencies. We assess the performance of the proposed multiscale adaptive model, MATEY, in a sequence of experiments. The results show that adaptive tokenization schemes achieve improved accuracy without significantly increasing the length of the token sequence. Compared to a full spatiotemporal attention scheme or a scheme that decouples only the temporal dimension, we find that fully decoupled axial attention is less efficient and expressive, requiring more training time and model weights to achieve the same accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate in two fine-tuning tasks featuring different physics that models pretrained on PDEBench data outperform the ones trained from scratch, especially in the low data regime with frozen attention.
