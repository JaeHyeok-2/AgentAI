Summary: The proliferation of complex deep learning (DL) models has revolutionized various applications, including computer vision-based solutions, prompting their integration into real-time systems. However, the resource-intensive nature of these models poses challenges for deployment on low-computational power and low-memory devices, like embedded and edge devices. This work empirically investigates the optimization of such complex DL models to analyze their functionality on an embedded device, particularly on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. It evaluates the effectiveness of the optimized models in terms of their inference speed for image classification and video action detection. The experimental results reveal that, on average, optimized models exhibit a 16.11% speed improvement over their non-optimized counterparts. This not only emphasizes the critical need to consider hardware constraints and environmental sustainability in model development and deployment but also underscores the pivotal role of model optimization in enabling the widespread deployment of AI-assisted technologies on resource-constrained computational systems. It also serves as proof that prioritizing hardware-specific model optimization leads to efficient and scalable solutions that substantially decrease energy consumption and carbon footprint.

Model: Arithmetic Intensity Balancing Convolution for Hardware-aware Efficient Block Design
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04016v1.pdf
Summary: As deep learning advances, edge devices and lightweight neural networks are becoming more important. To reduce latency in the AI accelerator, it's essential to not only reduce FLOPs but also enhance hardware performance. We proposed an arithmetic intensity balancing convolution (ABConv) to address the issue of the overall intensity being limited by the small weight arithmetic intensity for convolution with a small spatial size. ABConv increased the maximum bound of overall arithmetic intensity and significantly reduced latency, without sacrificing accuracy. We tested the latency and hardware performance of ABConv on the Arm Ethos-U65 NPU in various configurations and used it to replace some of MobileNetV1 and ResNet50 in image classification for CIFAR100.

Model: Optimal Layer Selection for Latent Data Augmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13426v1.pdf
Summary: While data augmentation (DA) is generally applied to input data, several studies have reported that applying DA to hidden layers in neural networks, i.e., feature augmentation, can improve performance. However, in previous studies, the layers to which DA is applied have not been carefully considered, often being applied randomly and uniformly or only to a specific layer, leaving room for arbitrariness. Thus, in this study, we investigated the trends of suitable layers for applying DA in various experimental configurations, e.g., training from scratch, transfer learning, various dataset settings, and different models. In addition, to adjust the suitable layers for DA automatically, we propose the adaptive layer selection (AdaLASE) method, which updates the ratio to perform DA for each layer based on the gradient descent method during training. The experimental results obtained on several image classification datasets indicate that the proposed AdaLASE method altered the ratio as expected and achieved high overall test accuracy.
