Model: A Study in Dataset Distillation for Image Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03656v1.pdf
Summary: Dataset distillation is the concept of condensing large datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While previous research has primarily focused on image classification, its application to image Super-Resolution (SR) remains underexplored. This exploratory work studies multiple dataset distillation techniques applied to SR, including pixel- and latent-space approaches under different aspects. Our experiments demonstrate that a 91.12% dataset size reduction can be achieved while maintaining comparable SR performance to the full dataset. We further analyze initialization strategies and distillation methods to optimize memory efficiency and computational costs. Our findings provide new insights into dataset distillation for SR and set the stage for future advancements.

Model: FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16025v1.pdf
Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Arithmetic Intensity Balancing Convolution for Hardware-aware Efficient Block Design
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04016v1.pdf
Summary: As deep learning advances, edge devices and lightweight neural networks are becoming more important. To reduce latency in the AI accelerator, it's essential to not only reduce FLOPs but also enhance hardware performance. We proposed an arithmetic intensity balancing convolution (ABConv) to address the issue of the overall intensity being limited by the small weight arithmetic intensity for convolution with a small spatial size. ABConv increased the maximum bound of overall arithmetic intensity and significantly reduced latency, without sacrificing accuracy. We tested the latency and hardware performance of ABConv on the Arm Ethos-U65 NPU in various configurations and used it to replace some of MobileNetV1 and ResNet50 in image classification for CIFAR100.
