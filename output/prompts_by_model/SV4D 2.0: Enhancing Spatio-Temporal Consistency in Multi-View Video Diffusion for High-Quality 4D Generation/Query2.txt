Model: Make-It-4D: Synthesizing a Consistent Long-Term Dynamic Scene Video from a Single Image
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10257v1.pdf
Summary: We study the problem of synthesizing a long-term dynamic video from only a single image. This is challenging since it requires consistent visual content movements given large camera motions. Existing methods either hallucinate inconsistent perpetual views or struggle with long camera trajectories. To address these issues, it is essential to estimate the underlying 4D (including 3D geometry and scene motion) and fill in the occluded regions. To this end, we present Make-It-4D, a novel method that can generate a consistent long-term dynamic video from a single image. On the one hand, we utilize layered depth images (LDIs) to represent a scene, and they are then unprojected to form a feature point cloud. To animate the visual content, the feature point cloud is displaced based on the scene flow derived from motion estimation and the corresponding camera pose. Such 4D representation enables our method to maintain the global consistency of the generated dynamic video. On the other hand, we fill in the occluded regions by using a pretrained diffusion model to inpaint and outpaint the input image. This enables our method to work under large camera motions. Benefiting from our design, our method can be training-free which saves a significant amount of training time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which showcases compelling rendering results.

Model: Cinematic Behavior Transfer via NeRF-based Differentiable Filming
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17754v1.pdf
Summary: In the evolving landscape of digital media and video production, the precise manipulation and reproduction of visual elements like camera movements and character actions are highly desired. Existing SLAM methods face limitations in dynamic scenes and human pose estimation often focuses on 2D projections, neglecting 3D statuses. To address these issues, we first introduce a reverse filming behavior estimation technique. It optimizes camera trajectories by leveraging NeRF as a differentiable renderer and refining SMPL tracks. We then introduce a cinematic transfer pipeline that is able to transfer various shot types to a new 2D video or a 3D virtual environment. The incorporation of 3D engine workflow enables superior rendering and control abilities, which also achieves a higher rating in the user study.

Model: CamCo: Camera-Controllable 3D-Consistent Image-to-Video Generation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02509v1.pdf
Summary: Recently video diffusion models have emerged as expressive generative tools for high-quality video content creation readily available to general users. However, these models often do not offer precise control over camera poses for video generation, limiting the expression of cinematic language and user control. To address this issue, we introduce CamCo, which allows fine-grained Camera pose Control for image-to-video generation. We equip a pre-trained image-to-video generator with accurately parameterized camera pose input using Pl\"ucker coordinates. To enhance 3D consistency in the videos produced, we integrate an epipolar attention module in each attention block that enforces epipolar constraints to the feature maps. Additionally, we fine-tune CamCo on real-world videos with camera poses estimated through structure-from-motion algorithms to better synthesize object motion. Our experiments show that CamCo significantly improves 3D consistency and camera control capabilities compared to previous models while effectively generating plausible object motion.
