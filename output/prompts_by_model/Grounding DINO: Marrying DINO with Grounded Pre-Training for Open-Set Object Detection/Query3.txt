You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I gave it natural sentences like “a cat sitting on the edge of the couch,” and it still found it without needing any labels. What kind of model can do that?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: LaMPP: Language Models as Probabilistic Priors for Perception and Action
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02801v1.pdf

Summary: Language models trained on large text corpora encode rich distributional information about real-world environments and action sequences. This information plays a crucial role in current approaches to language processing tasks like question answering and instruction generation. We describe how to leverage language models for *non-linguistic* perception and control tasks. Our approach casts labeling and decision-making as inference in probabilistic graphical models in which language models parameterize prior distributions over labels, decisions and parameters, making it possible to integrate uncertain observations and incomplete background knowledge in a principled way. Applied to semantic segmentation, household navigation, and activity recognition tasks, this approach improves predictions on rare, out-of-distribution, and structurally novel inputs.

Model: LabelPrompt: Effective Prompt-based Learning for Relation Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08068v2.pdf
Summary: Recently, prompt-based learning has gained popularity across many natural language processing (NLP) tasks by reformulating them into a cloze-style format to better align pre-trained language models (PLMs) with downstream tasks. However, applying this approach to relation classification poses unique challenges. Specifically, associating natural language words that fill the masked token with semantic relation labels (\textit{e.g.} \textit{``org:founded\_by}'') is difficult. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel prompt-based learning method, namely LabelPrompt, for the relation classification task. Motivated by the intuition to ``GIVE MODEL CHOICES!'', we first define additional tokens to represent relation labels, which regard these tokens as the verbaliser with semantic initialisation and explicitly construct them with a prompt template method. Then, to mitigate inconsistency between predicted relations and given entities, we implement an entity-aware module with contrastive learning. Last, we conduct an attention query strategy within the self-attention layer to differentiates prompt tokens and sequence tokens. Together, these strategies enhance the adaptability of prompt-based learning, especially when only small labelled datasets is available. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, particularly in the few-shot scenario.

Model: Sequential annotations for naturally-occurring HRI: first insights
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15097v1.pdf
Summary: We explain the methodology we developed for improving the interactions accomplished by an embedded conversational agent, drawing from Conversation Analytic sequential and multimodal analysis. The use case is a Pepper robot that is expected to inform and orient users in a library. In order to propose and learn better interactive schema, we are creating a corpus of naturally-occurring interactions that will be made available to the community. To do so, we propose an annotation practice based on some theoretical underpinnings about the use of language and multimodal resources in human-robot interaction.
