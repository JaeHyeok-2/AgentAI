Summary: In the evolving domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools in content creation. Despite their remarkable capability, existing models still face challenges in achieving controlled generation with a consistent style, requiring costly fine-tuning or often inadequately transferring the visual elements due to content leakage. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, \ours, to produce a diverse range of images while maintaining specific style elements and nuances. During the denoising process, we keep the query from original features while swapping the key and value with those from reference features in the late self-attention layers. This approach allows for the visual style prompting without any fine-tuning, ensuring that generated images maintain a faithful style. Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, best reflecting the style of the references and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts most accurately.

Model: Customize StyleGAN with One Hand Sketch
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18949v1.pdf
Summary: Generating images from human sketches typically requires dedicated networks trained from scratch. In contrast, the emergence of the pre-trained Vision-Language models (e.g., CLIP) has propelled generative applications based on controlling the output imagery of existing StyleGAN models with text inputs or reference images. Parallelly, our work proposes a framework to control StyleGAN imagery with a single user sketch. In particular, we learn a conditional distribution in the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN model via energy-based learning and propose two novel energy functions leveraging CLIP for cross-domain semantic supervision. Once trained, our model can generate multi-modal images semantically aligned with the input sketch. Quantitative evaluations on synthesized datasets have shown that our approach improves significantly from previous methods in the one-shot regime. The superiority of our method is further underscored when experimenting with a wide range of human sketches of diverse styles and poses. Surprisingly, our models outperform the previous baseline regarding both the range of sketch inputs and image qualities despite operating with a stricter setting: with no extra training data and single sketch input.

Model: Sketch-MoMa: Teleoperation for Mobile Manipulator via Interpretation of Hand-Drawn Sketches
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19153v3.pdf
Summary: To use assistive robots in everyday life, a remote control system with common devices, such as 2D devices, is helpful to control the robots anytime and anywhere as intended. Hand-drawn sketches are one of the intuitive ways to control robots with 2D devices. However, since similar sketches have different intentions from scene to scene, existing work needs additional modalities to set the sketches' semantics. This requires complex operations for users and leads to decreasing usability. In this paper, we propose Sketch-MoMa, a teleoperation system using the user-given hand-drawn sketches as instructions to control a robot. We use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the user-given sketches superimposed on an observation image and infer drawn shapes and low-level tasks of the robot. We utilize the sketches and the generated shapes for recognition and motion planning of the generated low-level tasks for precise and intuitive operations. We validate our approach using state-of-the-art VLMs with 7 tasks and 5 sketch shapes. We also demonstrate that our approach effectively specifies the detailed motions, such as how to grasp and how much to rotate. Moreover, we show the competitive usability of our approach compared with the existing 2D interface through a user experiment with 14 participants.
