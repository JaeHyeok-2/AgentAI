Model: Understanding Depth Map Progressively: Adaptive Distance Interval Separation for Monocular 3d Object Detection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10921v1.pdf
Summary: Monocular 3D object detection aims to locate objects in different scenes with just a single image. Due to the absence of depth information, several monocular 3D detection techniques have emerged that rely on auxiliary depth maps from the depth estimation task. There are multiple approaches to understanding the representation of depth maps, including treating them as pseudo-LiDAR point clouds, leveraging implicit end-to-end learning of depth information, or considering them as an image input. However, these methods have certain drawbacks, such as their reliance on the accuracy of estimated depth maps and suboptimal utilization of depth maps due to their image-based nature. While LiDAR-based methods and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be utilized for pseudo point clouds and depth maps, respectively, it is always an alternative. In this paper, we propose a framework named the Adaptive Distance Interval Separation Network (ADISN) that adopts a novel perspective on understanding depth maps, as a form that lies between LiDAR and images. We utilize an adaptive separation approach that partitions the depth map into various subgraphs based on distance and treats each of these subgraphs as an individual image for feature extraction. After adaptive separations, each subgraph solely contains pixels within a learned interval range. If there is a truncated object within this range, an evident curved edge will appear, which we can leverage for texture extraction using CNNs to obtain rich depth information in pixels. Meanwhile, to mitigate the inaccuracy of depth estimation, we designed an uncertainty module. To take advantage of both images and depth maps, we use different branches to learn localization detection tasks and appearance tasks separately.

Model: ImageNet-Hard: The Hardest Images Remaining from a Study of the Power of Zoom and Spatial Biases in Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05538v4.pdf
Summary: Image classifiers are information-discarding machines, by design. Yet, how these models discard information remains mysterious. We hypothesize that one way for image classifiers to reach high accuracy is to first zoom to the most discriminative region in the image and then extract features from there to predict image labels, discarding the rest of the image. Studying six popular networks ranging from AlexNet to CLIP, we find that proper framing of the input image can lead to the correct classification of 98.91% of ImageNet images. Furthermore, we uncover positional biases in various datasets, especially a strong center bias in two popular datasets: ImageNet-A and ObjectNet. Finally, leveraging our insights into the potential of zooming, we propose a test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions. Our method is more interpretable, accurate, and faster than MEMO, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTA method. We introduce ImageNet-Hard, a new benchmark that challenges SOTA classifiers including large vision-language models even when optimal zooming is allowed.

Model: Doppelgangers: Learning to Disambiguate Images of Similar Structures
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02420v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/RuojinCai/Doppelgangers
Summary: We consider the visual disambiguation task of determining whether a pair of visually similar images depict the same or distinct 3D surfaces (e.g., the same or opposite sides of a symmetric building). Illusory image matches, where two images observe distinct but visually similar 3D surfaces, can be challenging for humans to differentiate, and can also lead 3D reconstruction algorithms to produce erroneous results. We propose a learning-based approach to visual disambiguation, formulating it as a binary classification task on image pairs. To that end, we introduce a new dataset for this problem, Doppelgangers, which includes image pairs of similar structures with ground truth labels. We also design a network architecture that takes the spatial distribution of local keypoints and matches as input, allowing for better reasoning about both local and global cues. Our evaluation shows that our method can distinguish illusory matches in difficult cases, and can be integrated into SfM pipelines to produce correct, disambiguated 3D reconstructions.
