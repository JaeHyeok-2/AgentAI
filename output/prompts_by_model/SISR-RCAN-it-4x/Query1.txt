Model: Perceive, Excavate and Purify: A Novel Object Mining Framework for Instance Segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08826v1.pdf
Summary: Recently, instance segmentation has made great progress with the rapid development of deep neural networks. However, there still exist two main challenges including discovering indistinguishable objects and modeling the relationship between instances. To deal with these difficulties, we propose a novel object mining framework for instance segmentation. In this framework, we first introduce the semantics perceiving subnetwork to capture pixels that may belong to an obvious instance from the bottom up. Then, we propose an object excavating mechanism to discover indistinguishable objects. In the mechanism, preliminary perceived semantics are regarded as original instances with classifications and locations, and then indistinguishable objects around these original instances are mined, which ensures that hard objects are fully excavated. Next, an instance purifying strategy is put forward to model the relationship between instances, which pulls the similar instances close and pushes away different instances to keep intra-instance similarity and inter-instance discrimination. In this manner, the same objects are combined as the one instance and different objects are distinguished as independent instances. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed object mining framework.

Model: Understanding Depth Map Progressively: Adaptive Distance Interval Separation for Monocular 3d Object Detection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10921v1.pdf
Summary: Monocular 3D object detection aims to locate objects in different scenes with just a single image. Due to the absence of depth information, several monocular 3D detection techniques have emerged that rely on auxiliary depth maps from the depth estimation task. There are multiple approaches to understanding the representation of depth maps, including treating them as pseudo-LiDAR point clouds, leveraging implicit end-to-end learning of depth information, or considering them as an image input. However, these methods have certain drawbacks, such as their reliance on the accuracy of estimated depth maps and suboptimal utilization of depth maps due to their image-based nature. While LiDAR-based methods and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be utilized for pseudo point clouds and depth maps, respectively, it is always an alternative. In this paper, we propose a framework named the Adaptive Distance Interval Separation Network (ADISN) that adopts a novel perspective on understanding depth maps, as a form that lies between LiDAR and images. We utilize an adaptive separation approach that partitions the depth map into various subgraphs based on distance and treats each of these subgraphs as an individual image for feature extraction. After adaptive separations, each subgraph solely contains pixels within a learned interval range. If there is a truncated object within this range, an evident curved edge will appear, which we can leverage for texture extraction using CNNs to obtain rich depth information in pixels. Meanwhile, to mitigate the inaccuracy of depth estimation, we designed an uncertainty module. To take advantage of both images and depth maps, we use different branches to learn localization detection tasks and appearance tasks separately.

Model: Cohere3D: Exploiting Temporal Coherence for Unsupervised Representation Learning of Vision-based Autonomous Driving
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15583v1.pdf
Summary: Due to the lack of depth cues in images, multi-frame inputs are important for the success of vision-based perception, prediction, and planning in autonomous driving. Observations from different angles enable the recovery of 3D object states from 2D image inputs if we can identify the same instance in different input frames. However, the dynamic nature of autonomous driving scenes leads to significant changes in the appearance and shape of each instance captured by the camera at different time steps. To this end, we propose a novel contrastive learning algorithm, Cohere3D, to learn coherent instance representations in a long-term input sequence robust to the change in distance and perspective. The learned representation aids in instance-level correspondence across multiple input frames in downstream tasks. In the pretraining stage, the raw point clouds from LiDAR sensors are utilized to construct the long-term temporal correspondence for each instance, which serves as guidance for the extraction of instance-level representation from the vision-based bird's eye-view (BEV) feature map. Cohere3D encourages a consistent representation for the same instance at different frames but distinguishes between representations of different instances. We evaluate our algorithm by finetuning the pretrained model on various downstream perception, prediction, and planning tasks. Results show a notable improvement in both data efficiency and task performance.
