Model: Enhancing Generalizability of Representation Learning for Data-Efficient 3D Scene Understanding
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11283v1.pdf
Summary: The field of self-supervised 3D representation learning has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate the challenge presented by the scarcity of extensive, well-annotated datasets. However, it continues to be hindered by the lack of diverse, large-scale, real-world 3D scene datasets for source data. To address this shortfall, we propose Generalizable Representation Learning (GRL), where we devise a generative Bayesian network to produce diverse synthetic scenes with real-world patterns, and conduct pre-training with a joint objective. By jointly learning a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning task and an occlusion-aware reconstruction task, the model is primed with transferable, geometry-informed representations. Post pre-training on synthetic data, the acquired knowledge of the model can be seamlessly transferred to two principal downstream tasks associated with 3D scene understanding, namely 3D object detection and 3D semantic segmentation, using real-world benchmark datasets. A thorough series of experiments robustly display our method's consistent superiority over existing state-of-the-art pre-training approaches.

Model: Swin3D: A Pretrained Transformer Backbone for 3D Indoor Scene Understanding
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06906v3.pdf

Summary: The use of pretrained backbones with fine-tuning has been successful for 2D vision and natural language processing tasks, showing advantages over task-specific networks. In this work, we introduce a pretrained 3D backbone, called {\SST}, for 3D indoor scene understanding. We design a 3D Swin transformer as our backbone network, which enables efficient self-attention on sparse voxels with linear memory complexity, making the backbone scalable to large models and datasets. We also introduce a generalized contextual relative positional embedding scheme to capture various irregularities of point signals for improved network performance. We pretrained a large {\SST} model on a synthetic Structured3D dataset, which is an order of magnitude larger than the ScanNet dataset. Our model pretrained on the synthetic dataset not only generalizes well to downstream segmentation and detection on real 3D point datasets, but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods on downstream tasks with +2.3 mIoU and +2.2 mIoU on S3DIS Area5 and 6-fold semantic segmentation, +1.8 mIoU on ScanNet segmentation (val), +1.9 mAP@0.5 on ScanNet detection, and +8.1 mAP@0.5 on S3DIS detection. A series of extensive ablation studies further validate the scalability, generality, and superior performance enabled by our approach.

Model: LoCUS: Learning Multiscale 3D-consistent Features from Posed Images
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01095v1.pdf
Summary: An important challenge for autonomous agents such as robots is to maintain a spatially and temporally consistent model of the world. It must be maintained through occlusions, previously-unseen views, and long time horizons (e.g., loop closure and re-identification). It is still an open question how to train such a versatile neural representation without supervision. We start from the idea that the training objective can be framed as a patch retrieval problem: given an image patch in one view of a scene, we would like to retrieve (with high precision and recall) all patches in other views that map to the same real-world location. One drawback is that this objective does not promote reusability of features: by being unique to a scene (achieving perfect precision/recall), a representation will not be useful in the context of other scenes. We find that it is possible to balance retrieval and reusability by constructing the retrieval set carefully, leaving out patches that map to far-away locations. Similarly, we can easily regulate the scale of the learned features (e.g., points, objects, or rooms) by adjusting the spatial tolerance for considering a retrieval to be positive. We optimize for (smooth) Average Precision (AP), in a single unified ranking-based objective. This objective also doubles as a criterion for choosing landmarks or keypoints, as patches with high AP. We show results creating sparse, multi-scale, semantic spatial maps composed of highly identifiable landmarks, with applications in landmark retrieval, localization, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.
