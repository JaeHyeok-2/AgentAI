You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I typed “vivid oil-paint fantasy landscape,” and it produced a piece with real-looking brush strokes. How can AI create thick paint textures from such a short prompt, and what extra information does it juggle to make those strokes feel real?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: WorldSmith: Iterative and Expressive Prompting for World Building with a Generative AI
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13355v1.pdf
Summary: Crafting a rich and unique environment is crucial for fictional world-building, but can be difficult to achieve since illustrating a world from scratch requires time and significant skill. We investigate the use of recent multi-modal image generation systems to enable users iteratively visualize and modify elements of their fictional world using a combination of text input, sketching, and region-based filling. WorldSmith enables novice world builders to quickly visualize a fictional world with layered edits and hierarchical compositions. Through a formative study (4 participants) and first-use study (13 participants) we demonstrate that WorldSmith offers more expressive interactions with prompt-based models. With this work, we explore how creatives can be empowered to leverage prompt-based generative AI as a tool in their creative process, beyond current "click-once" prompting UI paradigms.

Model: A Large-scale AI-generated Image Inpainting Benchmark
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06593v1.pdf
Summary: Recent advancements in generative AI have made text-guided image inpainting -- adding, removing, or altering image regions using textual prompts -- widely accessible. However, generating semantically correct photorealistic imagery, typically requires carefully-crafted prompts and iterative refinement by evaluating the realism of the generated content - tasks commonly performed by humans. To automate the generative process, we propose Semantically Aligned and Uncertainty Guided AI Image Inpainting (SAGI), a model-agnostic pipeline, to sample prompts from a distribution that closely aligns with human perception and to evaluate the generated content and discard one that deviates from such a distribution, which we approximate using pretrained Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models. By applying this pipeline on multiple state-of-the-art inpainting models, we create the SAGI Dataset (SAGI-D), currently the largest and most diverse dataset of AI-generated inpaintings, comprising over 95k inpainted images and a human-evaluated subset. Our experiments show that semantic alignment significantly improves image quality and aesthetics, while uncertainty guidance effectively identifies realistic manipulations - human ability to distinguish inpainted images from real ones drops from 74% to 35% in terms of accuracy, after applying our pipeline. Moreover, using SAGI-D for training several image forensic approaches increases in-domain detection performance on average by 37.4% and out-of-domain generalization by 26.1% in terms of IoU, also demonstrating its utility in countering malicious exploitation of generative AI.

Model: DeepArt: A Benchmark to Advance Fidelity Research in AI-Generated Content
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10407v2.pdf
Summary: This paper explores the image synthesis capabilities of GPT-4, a leading multi-modal large language model. We establish a benchmark for evaluating the fidelity of texture features in images generated by GPT-4, comprising manually painted pictures and their AI-generated counterparts. The contributions of this study are threefold: First, we provide an in-depth analysis of the fidelity of image synthesis features based on GPT-4, marking the first such study on this state-of-the-art model. Second, the quantitative and qualitative experiments fully reveals the limitations of the GPT-4 model in image synthesis. Third, we have compiled a unique benchmark of manual drawings and corresponding GPT-4-generated images, introducing a new task to advance fidelity research in AI-generated content (AIGC).
