Model: NeuralLabeling: A versatile toolset for labeling vision datasets using Neural Radiance Fields
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11966v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/FlorisE/neural-labeling
Summary: We present NeuralLabeling, a labeling approach and toolset for annotating 3D scenes using either bounding boxes or meshes and generating segmentation masks, affordance maps, 2D bounding boxes, 3D bounding boxes, 6DOF object poses, depth maps, and object meshes. NeuralLabeling uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as a renderer, allowing labeling to be performed using 3D spatial tools while incorporating geometric clues such as occlusions, relying only on images captured from multiple viewpoints as input. To demonstrate the applicability of NeuralLabeling to a practical problem in robotics, we added ground truth depth maps to 30000 frames of transparent object RGB and noisy depth maps of glasses placed in a dishwasher captured using an RGBD sensor, yielding the Dishwasher30k dataset. We show that training a simple deep neural network with supervision using the annotated depth maps yields a higher reconstruction performance than training with the previously applied weakly supervised approach. We also show how instance segmentation and depth completion datasets generated using NeuralLabeling can be incorporated into a robot application for grasping transparent objects placed in a dishwasher with an accuracy of 83.3%, compared to 16.3% without depth completion.

Model: DeepAerialMapper: Deep Learning-based Semi-automatic HD Map Creation for Highly Automated Vehicles
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00769v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/robertkrajewski/deepaerialmapper
Summary: High-definition maps (HD maps) play a crucial role in the development, safety validation, and operation of highly automated vehicles. Efficiently collecting up-to-date sensor data from road segments and obtaining accurate maps from these are key challenges in HD map creation. Commonly used methods, such as dedicated measurement vehicles and crowd-sourced data from series vehicles, often face limitations in commercial viability. Although high-resolution aerial imagery offers a cost-effective or even free alternative, it requires significant manual effort and time to transform it into maps. In this paper, we introduce a semi-automatic method for creating HD maps from high-resolution aerial imagery. Our method involves training neural networks to semantically segment aerial images into classes relevant to HD maps. The resulting segmentation is then hierarchically post-processed to generate a prototypical HD map of visible road elements. Exporting the map to the Lanelet2 format allows easy extension for different use cases using standard tools. To train and evaluate our method, we created a dataset using public aerial imagery of urban road segments in Germany. In our evaluation, we achieved an automatic mapping of lane markings and road borders with a recall and precision exceeding 96%. The source code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/RobertKrajewski/DeepAerialMapper.

Model: RSUD20K: A Dataset for Road Scene Understanding In Autonomous Driving
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07322v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/hasibzunair/rsud20k
Summary: Road scene understanding is crucial in autonomous driving, enabling machines to perceive the visual environment. However, recent object detectors tailored for learning on datasets collected from certain geographical locations struggle to generalize across different locations. In this paper, we present RSUD20K, a new dataset for road scene understanding, comprised of over 20K high-resolution images from the driving perspective on Bangladesh roads, and includes 130K bounding box annotations for 13 objects. This challenging dataset encompasses diverse road scenes, narrow streets and highways, featuring objects from different viewpoints and scenes from crowded environments with densely cluttered objects and various weather conditions. Our work significantly improves upon previous efforts, providing detailed annotations and increased object complexity. We thoroughly examine the dataset, benchmarking various state-of-the-art object detectors and exploring large vision models as image annotators.
