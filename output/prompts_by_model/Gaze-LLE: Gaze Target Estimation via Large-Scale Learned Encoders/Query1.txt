You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I showed it a photo of someone just looking off to the side, and it could tell exactly what they were focused on. How does it figure out where people are looking so precisely?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22768v1.pdf

Summary: Many models of visual attention have been proposed so far. Traditional bottom-up models, like saliency models, fail to replicate human gaze patterns, and deep gaze prediction models lack biological plausibility due to their reliance on supervised learning. Vision Transformers (ViTs), with their self-attention mechanisms, offer a new approach but often produce dispersed attention patterns if trained with supervised learning. This study explores whether self-supervised DINO (self-DIstillation with NO labels) training enables ViTs to develop attention mechanisms resembling human visual attention. Using video stimuli to capture human gaze dynamics, we found that DINO-trained ViTs closely mimic human attention patterns, while those trained with supervised learning deviate significantly. An analysis of self-attention heads revealed three distinct clusters: one focusing on foreground objects, one on entire objects, and one on the background. DINO-trained ViTs offer insight into how human overt attention and figure-ground separation develop in visual perception.

Model: Gazeformer: Scalable, Effective and Fast Prediction of Goal-Directed Human Attention
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15274v3.pdf

Summary: Predicting human gaze is important in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, to practically serve HCI applications, gaze prediction models must be scalable, fast, and accurate in their spatial and temporal gaze predictions. Recent scanpath prediction models focus on goal-directed attention (search). Such models are limited in their application due to a common approach relying on trained target detectors for all possible objects, and the availability of human gaze data for their training (both not scalable). In response, we pose a new task called ZeroGaze, a new variant of zero-shot learning where gaze is predicted for never-before-searched objects, and we develop a novel model, Gazeformer, to solve the ZeroGaze problem. In contrast to existing methods using object detector modules, Gazeformer encodes the target using a natural language model, thus leveraging semantic similarities in scanpath prediction. We use a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture because transformers are particularly useful for generating contextual representations. Gazeformer surpasses other models by a large margin on the ZeroGaze setting. It also outperforms existing target-detection models on standard gaze prediction for both target-present and target-absent search tasks. In addition to its improved performance, Gazeformer is more than five times faster than the state-of-the-art target-present visual search model.

Model: Evaluating Webcam-based Gaze Data as an Alternative for Human Rationale Annotations
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19133v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/stephaniebrandl/rationales-eyetracking-xai
Summary: Rationales in the form of manually annotated input spans usually serve as ground truth when evaluating explainability methods in NLP. They are, however, time-consuming and often biased by the annotation process. In this paper, we debate whether human gaze, in the form of webcam-based eye-tracking recordings, poses a valid alternative when evaluating importance scores. We evaluate the additional information provided by gaze data, such as total reading times, gaze entropy, and decoding accuracy with respect to human rationale annotations. We compare WebQAmGaze, a multilingual dataset for information-seeking QA, with attention and explainability-based importance scores for 4 different multilingual Transformer-based language models (mBERT, distil-mBERT, XLMR, and XLMR-L) and 3 languages (English, Spanish, and German). Our pipeline can easily be applied to other tasks and languages. Our findings suggest that gaze data offers valuable linguistic insights that could be leveraged to infer task difficulty and further show a comparable ranking of explainability methods to that of human rationales.
