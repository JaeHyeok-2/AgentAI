You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"While watching a video, I always wondered what the person on screen was paying attention to—this tool made it totally clear. How does it visualize someone’s focus like that?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Model: FocusChat: Text-guided Long Video Understanding via Spatiotemporal Information Filtering
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12833v1.pdf
Summary: Recently, multi-modal large language models have made significant progress. However, visual information lacking of guidance from the user's intention may lead to redundant computation and involve unnecessary visual noise, especially in long, untrimmed videos. To address this issue, we propose FocusChat, a text-guided multi-modal large language model (LLM) that emphasizes visual information correlated to the user's prompt. In detail, Our model first undergoes the semantic extraction module, which comprises a visual semantic branch and a text semantic branch to extract image and text semantics, respectively. The two branches are combined using the Spatial-Temporal Filtering Module (STFM). STFM enables explicit spatial-level information filtering and implicit temporal-level feature filtering, ensuring that the visual tokens are closely aligned with the user's query. It lowers the essential number of visual tokens inputted into the LLM. FocusChat significantly outperforms Video-LLaMA in zero-shot experiments, using an order of magnitude less training data with only 16 visual tokens occupied. It achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art in few-shot experiments, with only 0.72M pre-training data.

Model: Emergence of Human-Like Attention in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers: an eye-tracking study
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22768v1.pdf

Summary: Many models of visual attention have been proposed so far. Traditional bottom-up models, like saliency models, fail to replicate human gaze patterns, and deep gaze prediction models lack biological plausibility due to their reliance on supervised learning. Vision Transformers (ViTs), with their self-attention mechanisms, offer a new approach but often produce dispersed attention patterns if trained with supervised learning. This study explores whether self-supervised DINO (self-DIstillation with NO labels) training enables ViTs to develop attention mechanisms resembling human visual attention. Using video stimuli to capture human gaze dynamics, we found that DINO-trained ViTs closely mimic human attention patterns, while those trained with supervised learning deviate significantly. An analysis of self-attention heads revealed three distinct clusters: one focusing on foreground objects, one on entire objects, and one on the background. DINO-trained ViTs offer insight into how human overt attention and figure-ground separation develop in visual perception.

Model: Evaluating Webcam-based Gaze Data as an Alternative for Human Rationale Annotations
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19133v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/stephaniebrandl/rationales-eyetracking-xai
Summary: Rationales in the form of manually annotated input spans usually serve as ground truth when evaluating explainability methods in NLP. They are, however, time-consuming and often biased by the annotation process. In this paper, we debate whether human gaze, in the form of webcam-based eye-tracking recordings, poses a valid alternative when evaluating importance scores. We evaluate the additional information provided by gaze data, such as total reading times, gaze entropy, and decoding accuracy with respect to human rationale annotations. We compare WebQAmGaze, a multilingual dataset for information-seeking QA, with attention and explainability-based importance scores for 4 different multilingual Transformer-based language models (mBERT, distil-mBERT, XLMR, and XLMR-L) and 3 languages (English, Spanish, and German). Our pipeline can easily be applied to other tasks and languages. Our findings suggest that gaze data offers valuable linguistic insights that could be leveraged to infer task difficulty and further show a comparable ranking of explainability methods to that of human rationales.
