Model: Online Overexposed Pixels Hallucination in Videos with Adaptive Reference Frame Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15462v1.pdf
Summary: Low dynamic range (LDR) cameras cannot deal with wide dynamic range inputs, frequently leading to local overexposure issues. We present a learning-based system to reduce these artifacts without resorting to complex acquisition mechanisms like alternating exposures or costly processing that are typical of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. We propose a transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) to infer the missing HDR details. In an ablation study, we show the importance of using a multiscale DNN and train it with the proper cost function to achieve state-of-the-art quality. To aid the reconstruction of the overexposed areas, our DNN takes a reference frame from the past as an additional input. This leverages the commonly occurring temporal instabilities of autoexposure to our advantage: since well-exposed details in the current frame may be overexposed in the future, we use reinforcement learning to train a reference frame selection DNN that decides whether to adopt the current frame as a future reference. Without resorting to alternating exposures, we obtain therefore a causal, HDR hallucination algorithm with potential application in common video acquisition settings.

Model: Make Me a BNN: A Simple Strategy for Estimating Bayesian Uncertainty from Pre-trained Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15297v1.pdf
Summary: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for various computer vision tasks, yet they often struggle with reliable uncertainty quantification - a critical requirement for real-world applications. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) are equipped for uncertainty estimation but cannot scale to large DNNs that are highly unstable to train. To address this challenge, we introduce the Adaptable Bayesian Neural Network (ABNN), a simple and scalable strategy to seamlessly transform DNNs into BNNs in a post-hoc manner with minimal computational and training overheads. ABNN preserves the main predictive properties of DNNs while enhancing their uncertainty quantification abilities through simple BNN adaptation layers (attached to normalization layers) and a few fine-tuning steps on pre-trained models. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, and our results demonstrate that ABNN achieves state-of-the-art performance without the computational budget typically associated with ensemble methods.

Model: Intelligent Multi-View Test Time Augmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08593v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/olivesgatech/Intelligent-Multi-View-TTA
Summary: In this study, we introduce an intelligent Test Time Augmentation (TTA) algorithm designed to enhance the robustness and accuracy of image classification models against viewpoint variations. Unlike traditional TTA methods that indiscriminately apply augmentations, our approach intelligently selects optimal augmentations based on predictive uncertainty metrics. This selection is achieved via a two-stage process: the first stage identifies the optimal augmentation for each class by evaluating uncertainty levels, while the second stage implements an uncertainty threshold to determine when applying TTA would be advantageous. This methodological advancement ensures that augmentations contribute to classification more effectively than a uniform application across the dataset. Experimental validation across several datasets and neural network architectures validates our approach, yielding an average accuracy improvement of 1.73% over methods that use single-view images. This research underscores the potential of adaptive, uncertainty-aware TTA in improving the robustness of image classification in the presence of viewpoint variations, paving the way for further exploration into intelligent augmentation strategies.
