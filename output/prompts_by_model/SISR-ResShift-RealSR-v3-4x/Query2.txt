Summary: In this study, we introduce an intelligent Test Time Augmentation (TTA) algorithm designed to enhance the robustness and accuracy of image classification models against viewpoint variations. Unlike traditional TTA methods that indiscriminately apply augmentations, our approach intelligently selects optimal augmentations based on predictive uncertainty metrics. This selection is achieved via a two-stage process: the first stage identifies the optimal augmentation for each class by evaluating uncertainty levels, while the second stage implements an uncertainty threshold to determine when applying TTA would be advantageous. This methodological advancement ensures that augmentations contribute to classification more effectively than a uniform application across the dataset. Experimental validation across several datasets and neural network architectures validates our approach, yielding an average accuracy improvement of 1.73% over methods that use single-view images. This research underscores the potential of adaptive, uncertainty-aware TTA in improving the robustness of image classification in the presence of viewpoint variations, paving the way for further exploration into intelligent augmentation strategies.

Model: Few-shot Algorithm Assurance
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20275v1.pdf
Summary: In image classification tasks, deep learning models are vulnerable to image distortion. For successful deployment, it is important to identify distortion levels under which the model is usable i.e. its accuracy stays above a stipulated threshold. We refer to this problem as Model Assurance under Image Distortion, and formulate it as a classification task. Given a distortion level, our goal is to predict if the model's accuracy on the set of distorted images is greater than a threshold. We propose a novel classifier based on a Level Set Estimation (LSE) algorithm, which uses the LSE's mean and variance functions to form the classification rule. We further extend our method to a "few sample" setting where we can only acquire few real images to perform the model assurance process. Our idea is to generate extra synthetic images using a novel Conditional Variational Autoencoder model with two new loss functions. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our classification method significantly outperforms strong baselines on five benchmark image datasets.

Model: Online Overexposed Pixels Hallucination in Videos with Adaptive Reference Frame Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15462v1.pdf
Summary: Low dynamic range (LDR) cameras cannot deal with wide dynamic range inputs, frequently leading to local overexposure issues. We present a learning-based system to reduce these artifacts without resorting to complex acquisition mechanisms like alternating exposures or costly processing that are typical of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. We propose a transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) to infer the missing HDR details. In an ablation study, we show the importance of using a multiscale DNN and train it with the proper cost function to achieve state-of-the-art quality. To aid the reconstruction of the overexposed areas, our DNN takes a reference frame from the past as an additional input. This leverages the commonly occurring temporal instabilities of autoexposure to our advantage: since well-exposed details in the current frame may be overexposed in the future, we use reinforcement learning to train a reference frame selection DNN that decides whether to adopt the current frame as a future reference. Without resorting to alternating exposures, we obtain therefore a causal, HDR hallucination algorithm with potential application in common video acquisition settings.
