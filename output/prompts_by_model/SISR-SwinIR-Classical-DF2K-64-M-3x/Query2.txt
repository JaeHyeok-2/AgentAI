Model: Online Overexposed Pixels Hallucination in Videos with Adaptive Reference Frame Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15462v1.pdf
Summary: Low dynamic range (LDR) cameras cannot deal with wide dynamic range inputs, frequently leading to local overexposure issues. We present a learning-based system to reduce these artifacts without resorting to complex acquisition mechanisms like alternating exposures or costly processing that are typical of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. We propose a transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) to infer the missing HDR details. In an ablation study, we show the importance of using a multiscale DNN and train it with the proper cost function to achieve state-of-the-art quality. To aid the reconstruction of the overexposed areas, our DNN takes a reference frame from the past as an additional input. This leverages the commonly occurring temporal instabilities of autoexposure to our advantage: since well-exposed details in the current frame may be overexposed in the future, we use reinforcement learning to train a reference frame selection DNN that decides whether to adopt the current frame as a future reference. Without resorting to alternating exposures, we obtain therefore a causal, HDR hallucination algorithm with potential application in common video acquisition settings.

Model: ImageNet-Hard: The Hardest Images Remaining from a Study of the Power of Zoom and Spatial Biases in Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05538v4.pdf
Summary: Image classifiers are information-discarding machines, by design. Yet, how these models discard information remains mysterious. We hypothesize that one way for image classifiers to reach high accuracy is to first zoom to the most discriminative region in the image and then extract features from there to predict image labels, discarding the rest of the image. Studying six popular networks ranging from AlexNet to CLIP, we find that proper framing of the input image can lead to the correct classification of 98.91% of ImageNet images. Furthermore, we uncover positional biases in various datasets, especially a strong center bias in two popular datasets: ImageNet-A and ObjectNet. Finally, leveraging our insights into the potential of zooming, we propose a test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions. Our method is more interpretable, accurate, and faster than MEMO, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTA method. We introduce ImageNet-Hard, a new benchmark that challenges SOTA classifiers including large vision-language models even when optimal zooming is allowed.

Model: Reverse Knowledge Distillation: Training a Large Model using a Small One for Retinal Image Matching on Limited Data
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10698v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/SaharAlmahfouzNasser/MeDAL-Retina
Summary: Retinal image matching plays a crucial role in monitoring disease progression and treatment response. However, datasets with matched keypoints between temporally separated pairs of images are not available in abundance to train transformer-based model. We propose a novel approach based on reverse knowledge distillation to train large models with limited data while preventing overfitting. Firstly, we propose architectural modifications to a CNN-based semi-supervised method called SuperRetina that help us improve its results on a publicly available dataset. Then, we train a computationally heavier model based on a vision transformer encoder using the lighter CNN-based model, which is counter-intuitive in the field knowledge-distillation research where training lighter models based on heavier ones is the norm. Surprisingly, such reverse knowledge distillation improves generalization even further. Our experiments suggest that high-dimensional fitting in representation space may prevent overfitting unlike training directly to match the final output. We also provide a public dataset with annotations for retinal image keypoint detection and matching to help the research community develop algorithms for retinal image applications.
