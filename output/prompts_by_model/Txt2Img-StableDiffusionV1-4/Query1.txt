Model: DebSDF: Delving into the Details and Bias of Neural Indoor Scene Reconstruction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15536v3.pdf
Summary: In recent years, the neural implicit surface has emerged as a powerful representation for multi-view surface reconstruction due to its simplicity and state-of-the-art performance. However, reconstructing smooth and detailed surfaces in indoor scenes from multi-view images presents unique challenges. Indoor scenes typically contain large texture-less regions, making the photometric loss unreliable for optimizing the implicit surface. Previous work utilizes monocular geometry priors to improve the reconstruction in indoor scenes. However, monocular priors often contain substantial errors in thin structure regions due to domain gaps and the inherent inconsistencies when derived independently from different views. This paper presents \textbf{DebSDF} to address these challenges, focusing on the utilization of uncertainty in monocular priors and the bias in SDF-based volume rendering. We propose an uncertainty modeling technique that associates larger uncertainties with larger errors in the monocular priors. High-uncertainty priors are then excluded from optimization to prevent bias. This uncertainty measure also informs an importance-guided ray sampling and adaptive smoothness regularization, enhancing the learning of fine structures. We further introduce a bias-aware signed distance function to density transformation that takes into account the curvature and the angle between the view direction and the SDF normals to reconstruct fine details better. Our approach has been validated through extensive experiments on several challenging datasets, demonstrating improved qualitative and quantitative results in reconstructing thin structures in indoor scenes, thereby outperforming previous work.

Summary: Traditionally, 3d indoor datasets have generally prioritized scale over ground-truth accuracy in order to obtain improved generalization. However, using these datasets to evaluate dense geometry tasks, such as depth rendering, can be problematic as the meshes of the dataset are often incomplete and may produce wrong ground truth to evaluate the details. In this paper, we propose SCRREAM, a dataset annotation framework that allows annotation of fully dense meshes of objects in the scene and registers camera poses on the real image sequence, which can produce accurate ground truth for both sparse 3D as well as dense 3D tasks. We show the details of the dataset annotation pipeline and showcase four possible variants of datasets that can be obtained from our framework with example scenes, such as indoor reconstruction and SLAM, scene editing & object removal, human reconstruction and 6d pose estimation. Recent pipelines for indoor reconstruction and SLAM serve as new benchmarks. In contrast to previous indoor dataset, our design allows to evaluate dense geometry tasks on eleven sample scenes against accurately rendered ground truth depth maps.

Model: VET: Visual Error Tomography for Point Cloud Completion and High-Quality Neural Rendering
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04634v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/lfranke/vet
Summary: In the last few years, deep neural networks opened the doors for big advances in novel view synthesis. Many of these approaches are based on a (coarse) proxy geometry obtained by structure from motion algorithms. Small deficiencies in this proxy can be fixed by neural rendering, but larger holes or missing parts, as they commonly appear for thin structures or for glossy regions, still lead to distracting artifacts and temporal instability. In this paper, we present a novel neural-rendering-based approach to detect and fix such deficiencies. As a proxy, we use a point cloud, which allows us to easily remove outlier geometry and to fill in missing geometry without complicated topological operations. Keys to our approach are (i) a differentiable, blending point-based renderer that can blend out redundant points, as well as (ii) the concept of Visual Error Tomography (VET), which allows us to lift 2D error maps to identify 3D-regions lacking geometry and to spawn novel points accordingly. Furthermore, (iii) by adding points as nested environment maps, our approach allows us to generate high-quality renderings of the surroundings in the same pipeline. In our results, we show that our approach can improve the quality of a point cloud obtained by structure from motion and thus increase novel view synthesis quality significantly. In contrast to point growing techniques, the approach can also fix large-scale holes and missing thin structures effectively. Rendering quality outperforms state-of-the-art methods and temporal stability is significantly improved, while rendering is possible at real-time frame rates.
