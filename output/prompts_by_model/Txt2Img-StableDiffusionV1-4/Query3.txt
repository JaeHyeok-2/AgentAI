Summary: Humans navigate in their environment by learning a mental model of the world through passive observation and active interaction. Their world model allows them to anticipate what might happen next and act accordingly with respect to an underlying objective. Such world models hold strong promises for planning in complex environments like in autonomous driving. A human driver, or a self-driving system, perceives their surroundings with their eyes or their cameras. They infer an internal representation of the world which should: (i) have spatial memory (e.g. occlusions), (ii) fill partially observable or noisy inputs (e.g. when blinded by sunlight), and (iii) be able to reason about unobservable events probabilistically (e.g. predict different possible futures). They are embodied intelligent agents that can predict, plan, and act in the physical world through their world model. In this thesis we present a general framework to train a world model and a policy, parameterised by deep neural networks, from camera observations and expert demonstrations. We leverage important computer vision concepts such as geometry, semantics, and motion to scale world models to complex urban driving scenes.   First, we propose a model that predicts important quantities in computer vision: depth, semantic segmentation, and optical flow. We then use 3D geometry as an inductive bias to operate in the bird's-eye view space. We present for the first time a model that can predict probabilistic future trajectories of dynamic agents in bird's-eye view from 360{\deg} surround monocular cameras only. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of learning a world model in closed-loop driving. Our model can jointly predict static scene, dynamic scene, and ego-behaviour in an urban driving environment.

Model: The 8th AI City Challenge
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09432v1.pdf
Summary: The eighth AI City Challenge highlighted the convergence of computer vision and artificial intelligence in areas like retail, warehouse settings, and Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS), presenting significant research opportunities. The 2024 edition featured five tracks, attracting unprecedented interest from 726 teams in 47 countries and regions. Track 1 dealt with multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) people tracking, highlighting significant enhancements in camera count, character number, 3D annotation, and camera matrices, alongside new rules for 3D tracking and online tracking algorithm encouragement. Track 2 introduced dense video captioning for traffic safety, focusing on pedestrian accidents using multi-camera feeds to improve insights for insurance and prevention. Track 3 required teams to classify driver actions in a naturalistic driving analysis. Track 4 explored fish-eye camera analytics using the FishEye8K dataset. Track 5 focused on motorcycle helmet rule violation detection. The challenge utilized two leaderboards to showcase methods, with participants setting new benchmarks, some surpassing existing state-of-the-art achievements.

Model: Efficient Robot Learning for Perception and Mapping
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14688v1.pdf
Summary: Holistic scene understanding poses a fundamental contribution to the autonomous operation of a robotic agent in its environment. Key ingredients include a well-defined representation of the surroundings to capture its spatial structure as well as assigning semantic meaning while delineating individual objects. Classic components from the toolbox of roboticists to address these tasks are simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and panoptic segmentation. Although recent methods demonstrate impressive advances, mostly due to employing deep learning, they commonly utilize in-domain training on large datasets. Since following such a paradigm substantially limits their real-world application, my research investigates how to minimize human effort in deploying perception-based robotic systems to previously unseen environments. In particular, I focus on leveraging continual learning and reducing human annotations for efficient learning. An overview of my work can be found at https://vniclas.github.io.
