Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: ImageNet-Hard: The Hardest Images Remaining from a Study of the Power of Zoom and Spatial Biases in Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05538v4.pdf
Summary: Image classifiers are information-discarding machines, by design. Yet, how these models discard information remains mysterious. We hypothesize that one way for image classifiers to reach high accuracy is to first zoom to the most discriminative region in the image and then extract features from there to predict image labels, discarding the rest of the image. Studying six popular networks ranging from AlexNet to CLIP, we find that proper framing of the input image can lead to the correct classification of 98.91% of ImageNet images. Furthermore, we uncover positional biases in various datasets, especially a strong center bias in two popular datasets: ImageNet-A and ObjectNet. Finally, leveraging our insights into the potential of zooming, we propose a test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions. Our method is more interpretable, accurate, and faster than MEMO, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTA method. We introduce ImageNet-Hard, a new benchmark that challenges SOTA classifiers including large vision-language models even when optimal zooming is allowed.

Model: Elastic-DETR: Making Image Resolution Learnable with Content-Specific Network Prediction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06341v1.pdf
Summary: Multi-scale image resolution is a de facto standard approach in modern object detectors, such as DETR. This technique allows for the acquisition of various scale information from multiple image resolutions. However, manual hyperparameter selection of the resolution can restrict its flexibility, which is informed by prior knowledge, necessitating human intervention. This work introduces a novel strategy for learnable resolution, called Elastic-DETR, enabling elastic utilization of multiple image resolutions. Our network provides an adaptive scale factor based on the content of the image with a compact scale prediction module (< 2 GFLOPs). The key aspect of our method lies in how to determine the resolution without prior knowledge. We present two loss functions derived from identified key components for resolution optimization: scale loss, which increases adaptiveness according to the image, and distribution loss, which determines the overall degree of scaling based on network performance. By leveraging the resolution's flexibility, we can demonstrate various models that exhibit varying trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity. We empirically show that our scheme can unleash the potential of a wide spectrum of image resolutions without constraining flexibility. Our models on MS COCO establish a maximum accuracy gain of 3.5%p or 26% decrease in computation than MS-trained DN-DETR.
