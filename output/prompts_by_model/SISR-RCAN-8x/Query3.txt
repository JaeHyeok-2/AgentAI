Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Summary: An important challenge for autonomous agents such as robots is to maintain a spatially and temporally consistent model of the world. It must be maintained through occlusions, previously-unseen views, and long time horizons (e.g., loop closure and re-identification). It is still an open question how to train such a versatile neural representation without supervision. We start from the idea that the training objective can be framed as a patch retrieval problem: given an image patch in one view of a scene, we would like to retrieve (with high precision and recall) all patches in other views that map to the same real-world location. One drawback is that this objective does not promote reusability of features: by being unique to a scene (achieving perfect precision/recall), a representation will not be useful in the context of other scenes. We find that it is possible to balance retrieval and reusability by constructing the retrieval set carefully, leaving out patches that map to far-away locations. Similarly, we can easily regulate the scale of the learned features (e.g., points, objects, or rooms) by adjusting the spatial tolerance for considering a retrieval to be positive. We optimize for (smooth) Average Precision (AP), in a single unified ranking-based objective. This objective also doubles as a criterion for choosing landmarks or keypoints, as patches with high AP. We show results creating sparse, multi-scale, semantic spatial maps composed of highly identifiable landmarks, with applications in landmark retrieval, localization, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

Model: Iterative Sizing Field Prediction for Adaptive Mesh Generation From Expert Demonstrations

Summary: Many engineering systems require accurate simulations of complex physical systems. Yet, analytical solutions are only available for simple problems, necessitating numerical approximations such as the Finite Element Method (FEM). The cost and accuracy of the FEM scale with the resolution of the underlying computational mesh. To balance computational speed and accuracy meshes with adaptive resolution are used, allocating more resources to critical parts of the geometry. Currently, practitioners often resort to hand-crafted meshes, which require extensive expert knowledge and are thus costly to obtain. Our approach, Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), views mesh generation as an imitation learning problem. AMBER combines a graph neural network with an online data acquisition scheme to predict the projected sizing field of an expert mesh on a given intermediate mesh, creating a more accurate subsequent mesh. This iterative process ensures efficient and accurate imitation of expert mesh resolutions on arbitrary new geometries during inference. We experimentally validate AMBER on heuristic 2D meshes and 3D meshes provided by a human expert, closely matching the provided demonstrations and outperforming a single-step CNN baseline.
