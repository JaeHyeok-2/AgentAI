A user has asked the following question:
"I upscaled a low-res animal picture and the fur returned naturally. How does AI streamline its steps to keep high-frequency detail with so few sampling rounds?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).

Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Human-Guided Image Generation for Expanding Small-Scale Training Image Datasets

Summary: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications (e.g., rare wildlife observation) is limited by the small number of available images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective way to address this limitation. However, since the automatic generation process is uncontrollable, the generated images are usually limited in diversity, and some of them are undesired. In this paper, we propose a human-guided image generation method for more controllable dataset expansion. We develop a multi-modal projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate the exploration of both the original and generated images. Based on the exploration, users refine the prompts and re-generate images for better performance. Since directly refining the prompts is challenging for novice users, we develop a sample-level prompt refinement method to make it easier. With this method, users only need to provide sample-level feedback (e.g., which samples are undesired) to obtain better prompts. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the multi-modal projection method, improved model performance in the case study for both classification and object detection tasks, and positive feedback from the experts.

Model: The Simpler The Better: An Entropy-Based Importance Metric To Reduce Neural Networks' Depth
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18949v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/vgcq/easier
Summary: While deep neural networks are highly effective at solving complex tasks, large pre-trained models are commonly employed even to solve consistently simpler downstream tasks, which do not necessarily require a large model's complexity. Motivated by the awareness of the ever-growing AI environmental impact, we propose an efficiency strategy that leverages prior knowledge transferred by large models. Simple but effective, we propose a method relying on an Entropy-bASed Importance mEtRic (EASIER) to reduce the depth of over-parametrized deep neural networks, which alleviates their computational burden. We assess the effectiveness of our method on traditional image classification setups. Our code is available at https://github.com/VGCQ/EASIER.
