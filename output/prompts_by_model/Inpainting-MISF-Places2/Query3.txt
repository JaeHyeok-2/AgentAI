Model: LoCUS: Learning Multiscale 3D-consistent Features from Posed Images
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01095v1.pdf
Summary: An important challenge for autonomous agents such as robots is to maintain a spatially and temporally consistent model of the world. It must be maintained through occlusions, previously-unseen views, and long time horizons (e.g., loop closure and re-identification). It is still an open question how to train such a versatile neural representation without supervision. We start from the idea that the training objective can be framed as a patch retrieval problem: given an image patch in one view of a scene, we would like to retrieve (with high precision and recall) all patches in other views that map to the same real-world location. One drawback is that this objective does not promote reusability of features: by being unique to a scene (achieving perfect precision/recall), a representation will not be useful in the context of other scenes. We find that it is possible to balance retrieval and reusability by constructing the retrieval set carefully, leaving out patches that map to far-away locations. Similarly, we can easily regulate the scale of the learned features (e.g., points, objects, or rooms) by adjusting the spatial tolerance for considering a retrieval to be positive. We optimize for (smooth) Average Precision (AP), in a single unified ranking-based objective. This objective also doubles as a criterion for choosing landmarks or keypoints, as patches with high AP. We show results creating sparse, multi-scale, semantic spatial maps composed of highly identifiable landmarks, with applications in landmark retrieval, localization, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

Model: SCRREAM : SCan, Register, REnder And Map:A Framework for Annotating Accurate and Dense 3D Indoor Scenes with a Benchmark
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22715v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/Junggy/SCRREAM
Summary: Traditionally, 3d indoor datasets have generally prioritized scale over ground-truth accuracy in order to obtain improved generalization. However, using these datasets to evaluate dense geometry tasks, such as depth rendering, can be problematic as the meshes of the dataset are often incomplete and may produce wrong ground truth to evaluate the details. In this paper, we propose SCRREAM, a dataset annotation framework that allows annotation of fully dense meshes of objects in the scene and registers camera poses on the real image sequence, which can produce accurate ground truth for both sparse 3D as well as dense 3D tasks. We show the details of the dataset annotation pipeline and showcase four possible variants of datasets that can be obtained from our framework with example scenes, such as indoor reconstruction and SLAM, scene editing & object removal, human reconstruction and 6d pose estimation. Recent pipelines for indoor reconstruction and SLAM serve as new benchmarks. In contrast to previous indoor dataset, our design allows to evaluate dense geometry tasks on eleven sample scenes against accurately rendered ground truth depth maps.

Model: MV-DeepSDF: Implicit Modeling with Multi-Sweep Point Clouds for 3D Vehicle Reconstruction in Autonomous Driving
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16715v1.pdf
Summary: Reconstructing 3D vehicles from noisy and sparse partial point clouds is of great significance to autonomous driving. Most existing 3D reconstruction methods cannot be directly applied to this problem because they are elaborately designed to deal with dense inputs with trivial noise. In this work, we propose a novel framework, dubbed MV-DeepSDF, which estimates the optimal Signed Distance Function (SDF) shape representation from multi-sweep point clouds to reconstruct vehicles in the wild. Although there have been some SDF-based implicit modeling methods, they only focus on single-view-based reconstruction, resulting in low fidelity. In contrast, we first analyze multi-sweep consistency and complementarity in the latent feature space and propose to transform the implicit space shape estimation problem into an element-to-set feature extraction problem. Then, we devise a new architecture to extract individual element-level representations and aggregate them to generate a set-level predicted latent code. This set-level latent code is an expression of the optimal 3D shape in the implicit space, and can be subsequently decoded to a continuous SDF of the vehicle. In this way, our approach learns consistent and complementary information among multi-sweeps for 3D vehicle reconstruction. We conduct thorough experiments on two real-world autonomous driving datasets (Waymo and KITTI) to demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art alternative methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
