Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15178v1.pdf
Summary: Transformer-based models have transformed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) and are increasingly applied to computer vision tasks with remarkable success. These models, renowned for their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information, offer a promising alternative to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision. In this review paper, we provide an extensive overview of various transformer architectures adapted for computer vision tasks. We delve into how these models capture global context and spatial relationships in images, empowering them to excel in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Analyzing the key components, training methodologies, and performance metrics of transformer-based models, we highlight their strengths, limitations, and recent advancements. Additionally, we discuss potential research directions and applications of transformer-based models in computer vision, offering insights into their implications for future advancements in the field.

Model: Text Classification: Neural Networks VS Machine Learning Models VS Pre-trained Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21022v1.pdf
Summary: Text classification is a very common task nowadays and there are many efficient methods and algorithms that we can employ to accomplish it. Transformers have revolutionized the field of deep learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have rapidly expanded to other domains such as computer vision, time-series analysis and more. The transformer model was firstly introduced in the context of machine translation and its architecture relies on self-attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships within data sequences. It is able to handle long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional neural networks (such as Recurrent Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptrons). In this work, we present a comparison between different techniques to perform text classification. We take into consideration seven pre-trained models, three standard neural networks and three machine learning models. For standard neural networks and machine learning models we also compare two embedding techniques: TF-IDF and GloVe, with the latter consistently outperforming the former. Finally, we demonstrate the results from our experiments where pre-trained models such as BERT and DistilBERT always perform better than standard models/algorithms.

Model: Analyzing Vision Transformers for Image Classification in Class Embedding Space

Summary: Despite the growing use of transformer models in computer vision, a mechanistic understanding of these networks is still needed. This work introduces a method to reverse-engineer Vision Transformers trained to solve image classification tasks. Inspired by previous research in NLP, we demonstrate how the inner representations at any level of the hierarchy can be projected onto the learned class embedding space to uncover how these networks build categorical representations for their predictions. We use our framework to show how image tokens develop class-specific representations that depend on attention mechanisms and contextual information, and give insights on how self-attention and MLP layers differentially contribute to this categorical composition. We additionally demonstrate that this method (1) can be used to determine the parts of an image that would be important for detecting the class of interest, and (2) exhibits significant advantages over traditional linear probing approaches. Taken together, our results position our proposed framework as a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability and explainability research.
