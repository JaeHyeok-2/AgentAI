Summary: With the rapid development of wearable cameras, a massive collection of egocentric video for first-person visual perception becomes available. Using egocentric videos to predict first-person activity faces many challenges, including limited field of view, occlusions, and unstable motions. Observing that sensor data from wearable devices facilitates human activity recognition, multi-modal activity recognition is attracting increasing attention. However, the deficiency of related dataset hinders the development of multi-modal deep learning for egocentric activity recognition. Nowadays, deep learning in real world has led to a focus on continual learning that often suffers from catastrophic forgetting. But the catastrophic forgetting problem for egocentric activity recognition, especially in the context of multiple modalities, remains unexplored due to unavailability of dataset. In order to assist this research, we present a multi-modal egocentric activity dataset for continual learning named UESTC-MMEA-CL, which is collected by self-developed glasses integrating a first-person camera and wearable sensors. It contains synchronized data of videos, accelerometers, and gyroscopes, for 32 types of daily activities, performed by 10 participants. Its class types and scale are compared with other publicly available datasets. The statistical analysis of the sensor data is given to show the auxiliary effects for different behaviors. And results of egocentric activity recognition are reported when using separately, and jointly, three modalities: RGB, acceleration, and gyroscope, on a base network architecture. To explore the catastrophic forgetting in continual learning tasks, four baseline methods are extensively evaluated with different multi-modal combinations. We hope the UESTC-MMEA-CL can promote future studies on continual learning for first-person activity recognition in wearable applications.

Model: Exo2EgoDVC: Dense Video Captioning of Egocentric Procedural Activities Using Web Instructional Videos
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16444v4.pdf
Summary: We propose a novel benchmark for cross-view knowledge transfer of dense video captioning, adapting models from web instructional videos with exocentric views to an egocentric view. While dense video captioning (predicting time segments and their captions) is primarily studied with exocentric videos (e.g., YouCook2), benchmarks with egocentric videos are restricted due to data scarcity. To overcome the limited video availability, transferring knowledge from abundant exocentric web videos is demanded as a practical approach. However, learning the correspondence between exocentric and egocentric views is difficult due to their dynamic view changes. The web videos contain shots showing either full-body or hand regions, while the egocentric view is constantly shifting. This necessitates the in-depth study of cross-view transfer under complex view changes. To this end, we first create a real-life egocentric dataset (EgoYC2) whose captions follow the definition of YouCook2 captions, enabling transfer learning between these datasets with access to their ground-truth. To bridge the view gaps, we propose a view-invariant learning method using adversarial training, which consists of pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of overcoming the view change problem and knowledge transfer to egocentric views. Our benchmark pushes the study of cross-view transfer into a new task domain of dense video captioning and envisions methodologies that describe egocentric videos in natural language.

Model: SLoMo: A General System for Legged Robot Motion Imitation from Casual Videos
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14389v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/johnzhang3/slomo
Summary: We present SLoMo: a first-of-its-kind framework for transferring skilled motions from casually captured "in the wild" video footage of humans and animals to legged robots. SLoMo works in three stages: 1) synthesize a physically plausible reconstructed key-point trajectory from monocular videos; 2) optimize a dynamically feasible reference trajectory for the robot offline that includes body and foot motion, as well as contact sequences that closely tracks the key points; 3) track the reference trajectory online using a general-purpose model-predictive controller on robot hardware. Traditional motion imitation for legged motor skills often requires expert animators, collaborative demonstrations, and/or expensive motion capture equipment, all of which limits scalability. Instead, SLoMo only relies on easy-to-obtain monocular video footage, readily available in online repositories such as YouTube. It converts videos into motion primitives that can be executed reliably by real-world robots. We demonstrate our approach by transferring the motions of cats, dogs, and humans to example robots including a quadruped (on hardware) and a humanoid (in simulation). To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first attempt at a general-purpose motion transfer framework that imitates animal and human motions on legged robots directly from casual videos without artificial markers or labels.
