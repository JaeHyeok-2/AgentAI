A user has asked the following question:
"I scanned some old photos, but there was so much noise on the image that it looked grainy. When I ran it through AI, it came out much cleaner—and I was surprised to see it even restored details. How does this kind of low-level denoising work? What kinds of techniques are commonly used for this today?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

Summary: Although learning-based image restoration methods have made significant progress, they still struggle with limited generalization to real-world scenarios due to the substantial domain gap caused by training on synthetic data. Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Summary: Images captured from the real world are often affected by different types of noise, which can significantly impact the performance of Computer Vision systems and the quality of visual data. This study presents a novel approach for defect detection in casting product noisy images, specifically focusing on submersible pump impellers. The methodology involves utilizing deep learning models such as VGG16, InceptionV3, and other models in both the spatial and frequency domains to identify noise types and defect status. The research process begins with preprocessing images, followed by applying denoising techniques tailored to specific noise categories. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of defect detection by integrating noise detection and denoising into the classification pipeline. The study achieved remarkable results using VGG16 for noise type classification in the frequency domain, achieving an accuracy of over 99%. Removal of salt and pepper noise resulted in an average SSIM of 87.9, while Gaussian noise removal had an average SSIM of 64.0, and periodic noise removal yielded an average SSIM of 81.6. This comprehensive approach showcases the effectiveness of the deep AutoEncoder model and median filter, for denoising strategies in real-world industrial applications. Finally, our study reports significant improvements in binary classification accuracy for defect detection compared to previous methods. For the VGG16 classifier, accuracy increased from 94.6% to 97.0%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed noise detection and denoising approach. Similarly, for the InceptionV3 classifier, accuracy improved from 84.7% to 90.0%, further validating the benefits of integrating noise analysis into the classification pipeline.

Model: Advancing low-field MRI with a universal denoising imaging transformer: Towards fast and high-quality imaging
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19167v1.pdf
Summary: Recent developments in low-field (LF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems present remarkable opportunities for affordable and widespread MRI access. A robust denoising method to overcome the intrinsic low signal-noise-ratio (SNR) barrier is critical to the success of LF MRI. However, current data-driven MRI denoising methods predominantly handle magnitude images and rely on customized models with constrained data diversity and quantity, which exhibit limited generalizability in clinical applications across diverse MRI systems, pulse sequences, and organs. In this study, we present ImT-MRD: a complex-valued imaging transformer trained on a vast number of clinical MRI scans aiming at universal MR denoising at LF systems. Compared with averaging multiple-repeated scans for higher image SNR, the model obtains better image quality from fewer repetitions, demonstrating its capability for accelerating scans under various clinical settings. Moreover, with its complex-valued image input, the model can denoise intermediate results before advanced post-processing and prepare high-quality data for further MRI research. By delivering universal and accurate denoising across clinical and research tasks, our model holds great promise to expedite the evolution of LF MRI for accessible and equal biomedical applications.
