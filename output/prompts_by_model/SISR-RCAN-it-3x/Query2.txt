Model: TraceNet: Segment one thing efficiently
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14874v1.pdf
Summary: Efficient single instance segmentation is essential for unlocking features in the mobile imaging applications, such as capture or editing. Existing on-the-fly mobile imaging applications scope the segmentation task to portraits or the salient subject due to the computational constraints. Instance segmentation, despite its recent developments towards efficient networks, is still heavy due to the cost of computation on the entire image to identify all instances. To address this, we propose and formulate a one tap driven single instance segmentation task that segments a single instance selected by a user via a positive tap. This task, in contrast to the broader task of segmenting anything as suggested in the Segment Anything Model \cite{sam}, focuses on efficient segmentation of a single instance specified by the user. To solve this problem, we present TraceNet, which explicitly locates the selected instance by way of receptive field tracing. TraceNet identifies image regions that are related to the user tap and heavy computations are only performed on selected regions of the image. Therefore overall computation cost and memory consumption are reduced during inference. We evaluate the performance of TraceNet on instance IoU average over taps and the proportion of the region that a user tap can fall into for a high-quality single-instance mask. Experimental results on MS-COCO and LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. TraceNet can jointly achieve the efficiency and interactivity, filling in the gap between needs for efficient mobile inference and recent research trend towards multimodal and interactive segmentation models.

Model: LV-UNet: A Lightweight and Vanilla Model for Medical Image Segmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16886v3.pdf

Summary: While large models have achieved significant progress in computer vision, challenges such as optimization complexity, the intricacy of transformer architectures, computational constraints, and practical application demands highlight the importance of simpler model designs in medical image segmentation. This need is particularly pronounced in mobile medical devices, which require lightweight, deployable models with real-time performance. However, existing lightweight models often suffer from poor robustness across datasets, limiting their widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LV-UNet, a lightweight and vanilla model that leverages pre-trained MobileNetv3-Large backbones and incorporates fusible modules. LV-UNet employs an enhanced deep training strategy and switches to a deployment mode during inference by re-parametrization, significantly reducing parameter count and computational overhead. Experimental results on ISIC 2016, BUSI, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, and Kvair-SEG datasets demonstrate a better trade-off between performance and the computational load. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/juntaoJianggavin/LV-UNet}.

Model: A Little Bit Attention Is All You Need for Person Re-Identification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14574v1.pdf
Summary: Person re-identification plays a key role in applications where a mobile robot needs to track its users over a long period of time, even if they are partially unobserved for some time, in order to follow them or be available on demand. In this context, deep-learning based real-time feature extraction on a mobile robot is often performed on special-purpose devices whose computational resources are shared for multiple tasks. Therefore, the inference speed has to be taken into account. In contrast, person re-identification is often improved by architectural changes that come at the cost of significantly slowing down inference. Attention blocks are one such example. We will show that some well-performing attention blocks used in the state of the art are subject to inference costs that are far too high to justify their use for mobile robotic applications. As a consequence, we propose an attention block that only slightly affects the inference speed while keeping up with much deeper networks or more complex attention blocks in terms of re-identification accuracy. We perform extensive neural architecture search to derive rules at which locations this attention block should be integrated into the architecture in order to achieve the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. Finally, we confirm that the best performing configuration on a re-identification benchmark also performs well on an indoor robotic dataset.
