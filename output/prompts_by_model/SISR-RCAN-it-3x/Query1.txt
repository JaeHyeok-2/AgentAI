Model: HAISTA-NET: Human Assisted Instance Segmentation Through Attention
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03105v3.pdf
Summary: Instance segmentation is a form of image detection which has a range of applications, such as object refinement, medical image analysis, and image/video editing, all of which demand a high degree of accuracy. However, this precision is often beyond the reach of what even state-of-the-art, fully automated instance segmentation algorithms can deliver. The performance gap becomes particularly prohibitive for small and complex objects. Practitioners typically resort to fully manual annotation, which can be a laborious process. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach to enable more precise predictions and generate higher-quality segmentation masks for high-curvature, complex and small-scale objects. Our human-assisted segmentation model, HAISTA-NET, augments the existing Strong Mask R-CNN network to incorporate human-specified partial boundaries. We also present a dataset of hand-drawn partial object boundaries, which we refer to as human attention maps. In addition, the Partial Sketch Object Boundaries (PSOB) dataset contains hand-drawn partial object boundaries which represent curvatures of an object's ground truth mask with several pixels. Through extensive evaluation using the PSOB dataset, we show that HAISTA-NET outperforms state-of-the art methods such as Mask R-CNN, Strong Mask R-CNN, and Mask2Former, achieving respective increases of +36.7, +29.6, and +26.5 points in AP-Mask metrics for these three models. We hope that our novel approach will set a baseline for future human-aided deep learning models by combining fully automated and interactive instance segmentation architectures.

Model: SOS: Segment Object System for Open-World Instance Segmentation With Object Priors
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14627v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/chwilms/sos
Summary: We propose an approach for Open-World Instance Segmentation (OWIS), a task that aims to segment arbitrary unknown objects in images by generalizing from a limited set of annotated object classes during training. Our Segment Object System (SOS) explicitly addresses the generalization ability and the low precision of state-of-the-art systems, which often generate background detections. To this end, we generate high-quality pseudo annotations based on the foundation model SAM. We thoroughly study various object priors to generate prompts for SAM, explicitly focusing the foundation model on objects. The strongest object priors were obtained by self-attention maps from self-supervised Vision Transformers, which we utilize for prompting SAM. Finally, the post-processed segments from SAM are used as pseudo annotations to train a standard instance segmentation system. Our approach shows strong generalization capabilities on COCO, LVIS, and ADE20k datasets and improves on the precision by up to 81.6% compared to the state-of-the-art.

Model: IAM: Enhancing RGB-D Instance Segmentation with New Benchmarks
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01685v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/aim-skku/box-is
Summary: Image segmentation is a vital task for providing human assistance and enhancing autonomy in our daily lives. In particular, RGB-D segmentation-leveraging both visual and depth cues-has attracted increasing attention as it promises richer scene understanding than RGB-only methods. However, most existing efforts have primarily focused on semantic segmentation and thus leave a critical gap. There is a relative scarcity of instance-level RGB-D segmentation datasets, which restricts current methods to broad category distinctions rather than fully capturing the fine-grained details required for recognizing individual objects. To bridge this gap, we introduce three RGB-D instance segmentation benchmarks, distinguished at the instance level. These datasets are versatile, supporting a wide range of applications from indoor navigation to robotic manipulation. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of various baseline models on these benchmarks. This comprehensive analysis identifies both their strengths and shortcomings, guiding future work toward more robust, generalizable solutions. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective method for RGB-D data integration. Extensive evaluations affirm the effectiveness of our approach, offering a robust framework for advancing toward more nuanced scene understanding.
