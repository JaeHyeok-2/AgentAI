You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I ran the same prompt with “realistic” and then “anime,” and the face structure stayed the same but the style completely changed—like magic. How does AI switch styles so smoothly?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Memory-Augmented Generative Adversarial Transformers
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19218v1.pdf
Summary: Conversational AI systems that rely on Large Language Models, like Transformers, have difficulty interweaving external data (like facts) with the language they generate. Vanilla Transformer architectures are not designed for answering factual questions with high accuracy. This paper investigates a possible route for addressing this problem. We propose to extend the standard Transformer architecture with an additional memory bank holding extra information (such as facts drawn from a knowledge base), and an extra attention layer for addressing this memory. We add this augmented memory to a Generative Adversarial Network-inspired Transformer architecture. This setup allows for implementing arbitrary felicity conditions on the generated language of the Transformer. We first demonstrate how this machinery can be deployed for handling factual questions in goal-oriented dialogues. Secondly, we demonstrate that our approach can be useful for applications like {\it style adaptation} as well: the adaptation of utterances according to certain stylistic (external) constraints, like social properties of human interlocutors in dialogues.

Model: WorldSmith: Iterative and Expressive Prompting for World Building with a Generative AI
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13355v1.pdf
Summary: Crafting a rich and unique environment is crucial for fictional world-building, but can be difficult to achieve since illustrating a world from scratch requires time and significant skill. We investigate the use of recent multi-modal image generation systems to enable users iteratively visualize and modify elements of their fictional world using a combination of text input, sketching, and region-based filling. WorldSmith enables novice world builders to quickly visualize a fictional world with layered edits and hierarchical compositions. Through a formative study (4 participants) and first-use study (13 participants) we demonstrate that WorldSmith offers more expressive interactions with prompt-based models. With this work, we explore how creatives can be empowered to leverage prompt-based generative AI as a tool in their creative process, beyond current "click-once" prompting UI paradigms.

Model: Diversify Question Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Style Transfer
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14503v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/gouqi666/rast
Summary: Given a textual passage and an answer, humans are able to ask questions with various expressions, but this ability is still challenging for most question generation (QG) systems. Existing solutions mainly focus on the internal knowledge within the given passage or the semantic word space for diverse content planning. These methods, however, have not considered the potential of external knowledge for expression diversity. To bridge this gap, we propose RAST, a framework for Retrieval-Augmented Style Transfer, where the objective is to utilize the style of diverse templates for question generation. For training RAST, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach that maximizes a weighted combination of diversity reward and consistency reward. Here, the consistency reward is computed by a Question-Answering (QA) model, whereas the diversity reward measures how much the final output mimics the retrieved template. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous diversity-driven baselines on diversity while being comparable in terms of consistency scores. Our code is available at https://github.com/gouqi666/RAST.
