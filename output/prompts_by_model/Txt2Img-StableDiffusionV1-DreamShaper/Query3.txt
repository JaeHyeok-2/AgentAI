You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"When I asked for a mix of fantasy and realism, the colors popped and the lighting felt dreamy but still believable. How does AI keep anatomy intact while changing artistic styles?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: Artificial Intelligence and Aesthetic Judgment
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12338v1.pdf
Summary: Generative AIs produce creative outputs in the style of human expression. We argue that encounters with the outputs of modern generative AI models are mediated by the same kinds of aesthetic judgments that organize our interactions with artwork. The interpretation procedure we use on art we find in museums is not an innate human faculty, but one developed over history by disciplines such as art history and art criticism to fulfill certain social functions. This gives us pause when considering our reactions to generative AI, how we should approach this new medium, and why generative AI seems to incite so much fear about the future. We naturally inherit a conundrum of causal inference from the history of art: a work can be read as a symptom of the cultural conditions that influenced its creation while simultaneously being framed as a timeless, seemingly acausal distillation of an eternal human condition. In this essay, we focus on an unresolved tension when we bring this dilemma to bear in the context of generative AI: are we looking for proof that generated media reflects something about the conditions that created it or some eternal human essence? Are current modes of interpretation sufficient for this task? Historically, new forms of art have changed how art is interpreted, with such influence used as evidence that a work of art has touched some essential human truth. As generative AI influences contemporary aesthetic judgment we outline some of the pitfalls and traps in attempting to scrutinize what AI generated media means.

Model: Transformation vs Tradition: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for Arts and Humanities
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19626v1.pdf
Summary: Recent advances in artificial general intelligence (AGI), particularly large language models and creative image generation systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities on diverse tasks spanning the arts and humanities. However, the swift evolution of AGI has also raised critical questions about its responsible deployment in these culturally significant domains traditionally seen as profoundly human. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the applications and implications of AGI for text, graphics, audio, and video pertaining to arts and the humanities. We survey cutting-edge systems and their usage in areas ranging from poetry to history, marketing to film, and communication to classical art. We outline substantial concerns pertaining to factuality, toxicity, biases, and public safety in AGI systems, and propose mitigation strategies. The paper argues for multi-stakeholder collaboration to ensure AGI promotes creativity, knowledge, and cultural values without undermining truth or human dignity. Our timely contribution summarizes a rapidly developing field, highlighting promising directions while advocating for responsible progress centering on human flourishing. The analysis lays the groundwork for further research on aligning AGI's technological capacities with enduring social goods.

Model: DeepArt: A Benchmark to Advance Fidelity Research in AI-Generated Content
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10407v2.pdf
Summary: This paper explores the image synthesis capabilities of GPT-4, a leading multi-modal large language model. We establish a benchmark for evaluating the fidelity of texture features in images generated by GPT-4, comprising manually painted pictures and their AI-generated counterparts. The contributions of this study are threefold: First, we provide an in-depth analysis of the fidelity of image synthesis features based on GPT-4, marking the first such study on this state-of-the-art model. Second, the quantitative and qualitative experiments fully reveals the limitations of the GPT-4 model in image synthesis. Third, we have compiled a unique benchmark of manual drawings and corresponding GPT-4-generated images, introducing a new task to advance fidelity research in AI-generated content (AIGC).
