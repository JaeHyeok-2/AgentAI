You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I enlarged a low-resolution image by 4x, and it looked surprisingly sharp and expressive. How does AI preserve detail and tone even at high magnifications?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.

Model: Saliency Suppressed, Semantics Surfaced: Visual Transformations in Neural Networks and the Brain

Summary: Deep learning algorithms lack human-interpretable accounts of how they transform raw visual input into a robust semantic understanding, which impedes comparisons between different architectures, training objectives, and the human brain. In this work, we take inspiration from neuroscience and employ representational approaches to shed light on how neural networks encode information at low (visual saliency) and high (semantic similarity) levels of abstraction. Moreover, we introduce a custom image dataset where we systematically manipulate salient and semantic information. We find that ResNets are more sensitive to saliency information than ViTs, when trained with object classification objectives. We uncover that networks suppress saliency in early layers, a process enhanced by natural language supervision (CLIP) in ResNets. CLIP also enhances semantic encoding in both architectures. Finally, we show that semantic encoding is a key factor in aligning AI with human visual perception, while saliency suppression is a non-brain-like strategy.

Model: AI-generated Image Quality Assessment in Visual Communication
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15677v1.pdf

Summary: Assessing the quality of artificial intelligence-generated images (AIGIs) plays a crucial role in their application in real-world scenarios. However, traditional image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms primarily focus on low-level visual perception, while existing IQA works on AIGIs overemphasize the generated content itself, neglecting its effectiveness in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AIGI-VC, a quality assessment database for AI-Generated Images in Visual Communication, which studies the communicability of AIGIs in the advertising field from the perspectives of information clarity and emotional interaction. The dataset consists of 2,500 images spanning 14 advertisement topics and 8 emotion types. It provides coarse-grained human preference annotations and fine-grained preference descriptions, benchmarking the abilities of IQA methods in preference prediction, interpretation, and reasoning. We conduct an empirical study of existing representative IQA methods and large multi-modal models on the AIGI-VC dataset, uncovering their strengths and weaknesses.
