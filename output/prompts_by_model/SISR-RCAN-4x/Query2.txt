Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15218v1.pdf
Summary: Combining high-level and low-level visual tasks is a common technique in the field of computer vision. This work integrates the technique of image super resolution to semantic segmentation for document image binarization.

Model: HiTSR: A Hierarchical Transformer for Reference-based Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16959v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/bia006/hitsr
Summary: In this paper, we propose HiTSR, a hierarchical transformer model for reference-based image super-resolution, which enhances low-resolution input images by learning matching correspondences from high-resolution reference images. Diverging from existing multi-network, multi-stage approaches, we streamline the architecture and training pipeline by incorporating the double attention block from GAN literature. Processing two visual streams independently, we fuse self-attention and cross-attention blocks through a gating attention strategy. The model integrates a squeeze-and-excitation module to capture global context from the input images, facilitating long-range spatial interactions within window-based attention blocks. Long skip connections between shallow and deep layers further enhance information flow. Our model demonstrates superior performance across three datasets including SUN80, Urban100, and Manga109. Specifically, on the SUN80 dataset, our model achieves PSNR/SSIM values of 30.24/0.821. These results underscore the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in reference-based image super-resolution. The transformer-based model attains state-of-the-art results without the need for purpose-built subnetworks, knowledge distillation, or multi-stage training, emphasizing the potency of attention in meeting reference-based image super-resolution requirements.

Model: Using super-resolution for enhancing visual perception and segmentation performance in veterinary cytology
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11848v1.pdf
Summary: The primary objective of this research was to enhance the quality of semantic segmentation in cytology images by incorporating super-resolution (SR) architectures. An additional contribution was the development of a novel dataset aimed at improving imaging quality in the presence of inaccurate focus. Our experimental results demonstrate that the integration of SR techniques into the segmentation pipeline can lead to a significant improvement of up to 25% in the mean average precision (mAP) segmentation metric. These findings suggest that leveraging SR architectures holds great promise for advancing the state of the art in cytology image analysis.
