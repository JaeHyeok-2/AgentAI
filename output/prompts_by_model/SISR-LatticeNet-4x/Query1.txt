Model: HiTSR: A Hierarchical Transformer for Reference-based Super-Resolution
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16959v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/bia006/hitsr
Summary: In this paper, we propose HiTSR, a hierarchical transformer model for reference-based image super-resolution, which enhances low-resolution input images by learning matching correspondences from high-resolution reference images. Diverging from existing multi-network, multi-stage approaches, we streamline the architecture and training pipeline by incorporating the double attention block from GAN literature. Processing two visual streams independently, we fuse self-attention and cross-attention blocks through a gating attention strategy. The model integrates a squeeze-and-excitation module to capture global context from the input images, facilitating long-range spatial interactions within window-based attention blocks. Long skip connections between shallow and deep layers further enhance information flow. Our model demonstrates superior performance across three datasets including SUN80, Urban100, and Manga109. Specifically, on the SUN80 dataset, our model achieves PSNR/SSIM values of 30.24/0.821. These results underscore the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in reference-based image super-resolution. The transformer-based model attains state-of-the-art results without the need for purpose-built subnetworks, knowledge distillation, or multi-stage training, emphasizing the potency of attention in meeting reference-based image super-resolution requirements.

Model: LoLiSRFlow: Joint Single Image Low-light Enhancement and Super-resolution via Cross-scale Transformer-based Conditional Flow
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18871v1.pdf
Summary: The visibility of real-world images is often limited by both low-light and low-resolution, however, these issues are only addressed in the literature through Low-Light Enhancement (LLE) and Super- Resolution (SR) methods. Admittedly, a simple cascade of these approaches cannot work harmoniously to cope well with the highly ill-posed problem for simultaneously enhancing visibility and resolution. In this paper, we propose a normalizing flow network, dubbed LoLiSRFLow, specifically designed to consider the degradation mechanism inherent in joint LLE and SR. To break the bonds of the one-to-many mapping for low-light low-resolution images to normal-light high-resolution images, LoLiSRFLow directly learns the conditional probability distribution over a variety of feasible solutions for high-resolution well-exposed images. Specifically, a multi-resolution parallel transformer acts as a conditional encoder that extracts the Retinex-induced resolution-and-illumination invariant map as the previous one. And the invertible network maps the distribution of usually exposed high-resolution images to a latent distribution. The backward inference is equivalent to introducing an additional constrained loss for the normal training route, thus enabling the manifold of the natural exposure of the high-resolution image to be immaculately depicted. We also propose a synthetic dataset modeling the realistic low-light low-resolution degradation, named DFSR-LLE, containing 7100 low-resolution dark-light/high-resolution normal sharp pairs. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both the proposed synthetic and real datasets.

Model: Online Overexposed Pixels Hallucination in Videos with Adaptive Reference Frame Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15462v1.pdf
Summary: Low dynamic range (LDR) cameras cannot deal with wide dynamic range inputs, frequently leading to local overexposure issues. We present a learning-based system to reduce these artifacts without resorting to complex acquisition mechanisms like alternating exposures or costly processing that are typical of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. We propose a transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) to infer the missing HDR details. In an ablation study, we show the importance of using a multiscale DNN and train it with the proper cost function to achieve state-of-the-art quality. To aid the reconstruction of the overexposed areas, our DNN takes a reference frame from the past as an additional input. This leverages the commonly occurring temporal instabilities of autoexposure to our advantage: since well-exposed details in the current frame may be overexposed in the future, we use reinforcement learning to train a reference frame selection DNN that decides whether to adopt the current frame as a future reference. Without resorting to alternating exposures, we obtain therefore a causal, HDR hallucination algorithm with potential application in common video acquisition settings.
