Model: Network-Based Video Recommendation Using Viewing Patterns and Modularity Analysis: An Integrated Framework
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12743v3.pdf
Summary: The proliferation of video-on-demand (VOD) services has led to a paradox of choice, overwhelming users with vast content libraries and revealing limitations in current recommender systems. This research introduces a novel approach by combining implicit user data, such as viewing percentages, with social network analysis to enhance personalization in VOD platforms. The methodology constructs user-item interaction graphs based on viewing patterns and applies centrality measures (degree, closeness, and betweenness) to identify important videos. Modularity-based clustering groups related content, enabling personalized recommendations. The system was evaluated on a documentary-focused VOD platform with 328 users over four months. Results showed significant improvements: a 63% increase in click-through rate (CTR), a 24% increase in view completion rate, and a 17% improvement in user satisfaction. The approach outperformed traditional methods like Naive Bayes and SVM. Future research should explore advanced techniques, such as matrix factorization models, graph neural networks, and hybrid approaches combining content-based and collaborative filtering. Additionally, incorporating temporal models and addressing scalability challenges for large-scale platforms are essential next steps. This study contributes to the state of the art by introducing modularity-based clustering and ego-centric ranking methods to enhance personalization in video recommendations. The findings suggest that integrating network-based features and implicit feedback can significantly improve user engagement, offering a cost-effective solution for VOD platforms to enhance recommendation quality.

Model: Direct Preference Optimization of Video Large Multimodal Models from Language Model Reward

Summary: Preference modeling techniques, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), has shown effective in enhancing the generalization abilities of large language model (LLM). However, in tasks involving video instruction-following, providing informative feedback, especially for detecting hallucinations in generated responses, remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have explored using large large multimodal models (LMMs) as reward models to guide preference modeling, but their ability to accurately assess the factuality of generated responses compared to corresponding videos has not been conclusively established. This paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes detailed video captions as a proxy of video content, enabling language models to incorporate this information as supporting evidence for scoring video Question Answering (QA) predictions. Our approach demonstrates robust alignment with OpenAI GPT-4V model's reward mechanism, which directly takes video frames as input. Furthermore, we show that applying this tailored reward through DPO significantly improves the performance of video LMMs on video QA tasks.

Model: Towards Generalist Robot Learning from Internet Video: A Survey
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19664v4.pdf
Summary: Scaling deep learning to massive, diverse internet data has yielded remarkably general capabilities in visual and natural language understanding and generation. However, data has remained scarce and challenging to collect in robotics, seeing robot learning struggle to obtain similarly general capabilities. Promising Learning from Videos (LfV) methods aim to address the robotics data bottleneck by augmenting traditional robot data with large-scale internet video data. This video data offers broad foundational information regarding physical behaviour and the underlying physics of the world, and thus can be highly informative for a generalist robot.   In this survey, we present a thorough overview of the emerging field of LfV. We outline fundamental concepts, including the benefits and challenges of LfV. We provide a comprehensive review of current methods for extracting knowledge from large-scale internet video, addressing key challenges in LfV, and boosting downstream robot and reinforcement learning via the use of video data. The survey concludes with a critical discussion of challenges and opportunities in LfV. Here, we advocate for scalable foundation model approaches that can leverage the full range of available internet video to improve the learning of robot policies and dynamics models. We hope this survey can inform and catalyse further LfV research, driving progress towards the development of general-purpose robots.
