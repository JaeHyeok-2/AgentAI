Model: Fairness Through Domain Awareness: Mitigating Popularity Bias For Music Discovery
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14601v1.pdf
Summary: As online music platforms grow, music recommender systems play a vital role in helping users navigate and discover content within their vast musical databases. At odds with this larger goal, is the presence of popularity bias, which causes algorithmic systems to favor mainstream content over, potentially more relevant, but niche items. In this work we explore the intrinsic relationship between music discovery and popularity bias. To mitigate this issue we propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach which addresses popularity bias in graph neural network (GNNs) based recommender systems. Our approach uses individual fairness to reflect a ground truth listening experience, i.e., if two songs sound similar, this similarity should be reflected in their representations. In doing so, we facilitate meaningful music discovery that is robust to popularity bias and grounded in the music domain. We apply our BOOST methodology to two discovery based tasks, performing recommendations at both the playlist level and user level. Then, we ground our evaluation in the cold start setting, showing that our approach outperforms existing fairness benchmarks in both performance and recommendation of lesser-known content. Finally, our analysis explains why our proposed methodology is a novel and promising approach to mitigating popularity bias and improving the discovery of new and niche content in music recommender systems.

Model: Utilizing Mood-Inducing Background Music in Human-Robot Interaction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14269v1.pdf
Summary: Past research has clearly established that music can affect mood and that mood affects emotional and cognitive processing, and thus decision-making. It follows that if a robot interacting with a person needs to predict the person's behavior, knowledge of the music the person is listening to when acting is a potentially relevant feature. To date, however, there has not been any concrete evidence that a robot can improve its human-interactive decision-making by taking into account what the person is listening to. This research fills this gap by reporting the results of an experiment in which human participants were required to complete a task in the presence of an autonomous agent while listening to background music. Specifically, the participants drove a simulated car through an intersection while listening to music. The intersection was not empty, as another simulated vehicle, controlled autonomously, was also crossing the intersection in a different direction. Our results clearly indicate that such background information can be effectively incorporated in an agent's world representation in order to better predict people's behavior. We subsequently analyze how knowledge of music impacted both participant behavior and the resulting learned policy.\setcounter{footnote}{2}\footnote{An earlier version of part of the material in this paper appeared originally in the first author's Ph.D. Dissertation~\cite{liebman2020sequential} but it has not appeared in any pear-reviewed conference or journal.}

Model: Leave-One-EquiVariant: Alleviating invariance-related information loss in contrastive music representations
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18955v1.pdf
Summary: Contrastive learning has proven effective in self-supervised musical representation learning, particularly for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks. However, reliance on augmentation chains for contrastive view generation and the resulting learnt invariances pose challenges when different downstream tasks require sensitivity to certain musical attributes. To address this, we propose the Leave One EquiVariant (LOEV) framework, which introduces a flexible, task-adaptive approach compared to previous work by selectively preserving information about specific augmentations, allowing the model to maintain task-relevant equivariances. We demonstrate that LOEV alleviates information loss related to learned invariances, improving performance on augmentation related tasks and retrieval without sacrificing general representation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a variant of LOEV, LOEV++, which builds a disentangled latent space by design in a self-supervised manner, and enables targeted retrieval based on augmentation related attributes.
