Model: RefineVIS: Video Instance Segmentation with Temporal Attention Refinement
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04774v1.pdf
Summary: We introduce a novel framework called RefineVIS for Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) that achieves good object association between frames and accurate segmentation masks by iteratively refining the representations using sequence context. RefineVIS learns two separate representations on top of an off-the-shelf frame-level image instance segmentation model: an association representation responsible for associating objects across frames and a segmentation representation that produces accurate segmentation masks. Contrastive learning is utilized to learn temporally stable association representations. A Temporal Attention Refinement (TAR) module learns discriminative segmentation representations by exploiting temporal relationships and a novel temporal contrastive denoising technique. Our method supports both online and offline inference. It achieves state-of-the-art video instance segmentation accuracy on YouTube-VIS 2019 (64.4 AP), Youtube-VIS 2021 (61.4 AP), and OVIS (46.1 AP) datasets. The visualization shows that the TAR module can generate more accurate instance segmentation masks, particularly for challenging cases such as highly occluded objects.

Model: SAM-PD: How Far Can SAM Take Us in Tracking and Segmenting Anything in Videos by Prompt Denoising
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04194v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/infzhou/sam-pd
Summary: Recently, promptable segmentation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have demonstrated robust zero-shot generalization capabilities on static images. These promptable models exhibit denoising abilities for imprecise prompt inputs, such as imprecise bounding boxes. In this paper, we explore the potential of applying SAM to track and segment objects in videos where we recognize the tracking task as a prompt denoising task. Specifically, we iteratively propagate the bounding box of each object's mask in the preceding frame as the prompt for the next frame. Furthermore, to enhance SAM's denoising capability against position and size variations, we propose a multi-prompt strategy where we provide multiple jittered and scaled box prompts for each object and preserve the mask prediction with the highest semantic similarity to the template mask. We also introduce a point-based refinement stage to handle occlusions and reduce cumulative errors. Without involving tracking modules, our approach demonstrates comparable performance in video object/instance segmentation tasks on three datasets: DAVIS2017, YouTubeVOS2018, and UVO, serving as a concise baseline and endowing SAM-based downstream applications with tracking capabilities.

Model: MegaSaM: Accurate, Fast, and Robust Structure and Motion from Casual Dynamic Videos
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04463v2.pdf
Summary: We present a system that allows for accurate, fast, and robust estimation of camera parameters and depth maps from casual monocular videos of dynamic scenes. Most conventional structure from motion and monocular SLAM techniques assume input videos that feature predominantly static scenes with large amounts of parallax. Such methods tend to produce erroneous estimates in the absence of these conditions. Recent neural network-based approaches attempt to overcome these challenges; however, such methods are either computationally expensive or brittle when run on dynamic videos with uncontrolled camera motion or unknown field of view. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of a deep visual SLAM framework: with careful modifications to its training and inference schemes, this system can scale to real-world videos of complex dynamic scenes with unconstrained camera paths, including videos with little camera parallax. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos demonstrate that our system is significantly more accurate and robust at camera pose and depth estimation when compared with prior and concurrent work, with faster or comparable running times.
