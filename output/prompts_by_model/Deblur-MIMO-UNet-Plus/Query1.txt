You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"Some of my older phone pictures looked blurry overall, but AI made them noticeably clearer. At first I thought it just increased sharpness, but it seems like it actually restores lost content. How is that possible, and what kind of technology is used for this kind of deblurring?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Use **only the provided models and papers**. Do not refer to outside sources.

Model: DeblurGS: Gaussian Splatting for Camera Motion Blur
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11358v2.pdf
Summary: Although significant progress has been made in reconstructing sharp 3D scenes from motion-blurred images, a transition to real-world applications remains challenging. The primary obstacle stems from the severe blur which leads to inaccuracies in the acquisition of initial camera poses through Structure-from-Motion, a critical aspect often overlooked by previous approaches. To address this challenge, we propose DeblurGS, a method to optimize sharp 3D Gaussian Splatting from motion-blurred images, even with the noisy camera pose initialization. We restore a fine-grained sharp scene by leveraging the remarkable reconstruction capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach estimates the 6-Degree-of-Freedom camera motion for each blurry observation and synthesizes corresponding blurry renderings for the optimization process. Furthermore, we propose Gaussian Densification Annealing strategy to prevent the generation of inaccurate Gaussians at erroneous locations during the early training stages when camera motion is still imprecise. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our DeblurGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in deblurring and novel view synthesis for real-world and synthetic benchmark datasets, as well as field-captured blurry smartphone videos.

Model: Patch-wise Features for Blur Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03156v1.pdf
Summary: Images captured through smartphone cameras often suffer from degradation, blur being one of the major ones, posing a challenge in processing these images for downstream tasks. In this paper we propose low-compute lightweight patch-wise features for image quality assessment. Using our method we can discriminate between blur vs sharp image degradation. To this end, we train a decision-tree based XGBoost model on various intuitive image features like gray level variance, first and second order gradients, texture features like local binary patterns. Experiments conducted on an open dataset show that the proposed low compute method results in 90.1% mean accuracy on the validation set, which is comparable to the accuracy of a compute-intensive VGG16 network with 94% mean accuracy fine-tuned to this task. To demonstrate the generalizability of our proposed features and model we test the model on BHBID dataset and an internal dataset where we attain accuracy of 98% and 91%, respectively. The proposed method is 10x faster than the VGG16 based model on CPU and scales linearly to the input image size making it suitable to be implemented on low compute edge devices.

Model: CausalSR: Structural Causal Model-Driven Super-Resolution with Counterfactual Inference
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15852v1.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/Mnster00/CasualSR
Summary: Physical and optical factors interacting with sensor characteristics create complex image degradation patterns. Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.
