You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I started typing a sentence, and it filled in the rest in such a natural way—even with a super long document. How does it handle that so smoothly?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Model: Read and Think: An Efficient Step-wise Multimodal Language Model for Document Understanding and Reasoning
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00816v3.pdf
Summary: Understanding the contents of multimodal documents is essential to accurately extract relevant evidence and use it for reasoning. Existing document understanding models tend to generate answers with a single word or phrase directly, ignoring the source document's evidence and lacking interpretability. In this work, we address the lack of step-wise capabilities through data augmentation and extension. Specifically, We use Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which have strong visual understanding and reasoning abilities, as data generators to generate step-wise question-and-answer pairs for document images and use a high-performance LLM as the error detector to filter out noisy data. This step-wise data generation pipeline is implemented using both template-based and few-shot methods. We then use the generated high-quality data to train a humanized document understanding and reasoning model, specifically designed to solve complex questions that require reasoning or multi-hop question answering, dubbed DocAssistant. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and application value of step-wise generation, showing a 5 improvement on InfoVQA with complex layouts and a 7 improvement on ChartQA with complex reasoning, compared to directly generated answers. We hope our work highlights the potential of synthetic data and encourages further exploration of multi-modal document reasoning capabilities.

Model: LAPDoc: Layout-Aware Prompting for Documents
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09841v1.pdf
Summary: Recent advances in training large language models (LLMs) using massive amounts of solely textual data lead to strong generalization across many domains and tasks, including document-specific tasks. Opposed to that there is a trend to train multi-modal transformer architectures tailored for document understanding that are designed specifically to fuse textual inputs with the corresponding document layout. This involves a separate fine-tuning step for which additional training data is required. At present, no document transformers with comparable generalization to LLMs are available That raises the question which type of model is to be preferred for document understanding tasks. In this paper we investigate the possibility to use purely text-based LLMs for document-specific tasks by using layout enrichment. We explore drop-in modifications and rule-based methods to enrich purely textual LLM prompts with layout information. In our experiments we investigate the effects on the commercial ChatGPT model and the open-source LLM Solar. We demonstrate that using our approach both LLMs show improved performance on various standard document benchmarks. In addition, we study the impact of noisy OCR and layout errors, as well as the limitations of LLMs when it comes to utilizing document layout. Our results indicate that layout enrichment can improve the performance of purely text-based LLMs for document understanding by up to 15% compared to just using plain document text. In conclusion, this approach should be considered for the best model choice between text-based LLM or multi-modal document transformers.

Model: Graphy'our Data: Towards End-to-End Modeling, Exploring and Generating Report from Raw Data
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16868v1.pdf
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and autonomous AI agent workflows. Yet, when faced with large sets of unstructured documents requiring progressive exploration, analysis, and synthesis, such as conducting literature survey, existing approaches often fall short. We address this challenge -- termed Progressive Document Investigation -- by introducing Graphy, an end-to-end platform that automates data modeling, exploration and high-quality report generation in a user-friendly manner. Graphy comprises an offline Scrapper that transforms raw documents into a structured graph of Fact and Dimension nodes, and an online Surveyor that enables iterative exploration and LLM-driven report generation. We showcase a pre-scrapped graph of over 50,000 papers -- complete with their references -- demonstrating how Graphy facilitates the literature-survey scenario.
