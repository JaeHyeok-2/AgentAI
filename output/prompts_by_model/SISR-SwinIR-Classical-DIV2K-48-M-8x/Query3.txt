Model: DualAug: Exploiting Additional Heavy Augmentation with OOD Data Rejection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08139v2.pdf

Summary: Data augmentation is a dominant method for reducing model overfitting and improving generalization. Most existing data augmentation methods tend to find a compromise in augmenting the data, \textit{i.e.}, increasing the amplitude of augmentation carefully to avoid degrading some data too much and doing harm to the model performance. We delve into the relationship between data augmentation and model performance, revealing that the performance drop with heavy augmentation comes from the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Nonetheless, as the same data transformation has different effects for different training samples, even for heavy augmentation, there remains part of in-distribution data which is beneficial to model training. Based on the observation, we propose a novel data augmentation method, named \textbf{DualAug}, to keep the augmentation in distribution as much as possible at a reasonable time and computational cost. We design a data mixing strategy to fuse augmented data from both the basic- and the heavy-augmentation branches. Extensive experiments on supervised image classification benchmarks show that DualAug improve various automated data augmentation method. Moreover, the experiments on semi-supervised learning and contrastive self-supervised learning demonstrate that our DualAug can also improve related method.

Model: Human-Guided Image Generation for Expanding Small-Scale Training Image Datasets
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16839v2.pdf

Summary: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications (e.g., rare wildlife observation) is limited by the small number of available images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective way to address this limitation. However, since the automatic generation process is uncontrollable, the generated images are usually limited in diversity, and some of them are undesired. In this paper, we propose a human-guided image generation method for more controllable dataset expansion. We develop a multi-modal projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate the exploration of both the original and generated images. Based on the exploration, users refine the prompts and re-generate images for better performance. Since directly refining the prompts is challenging for novice users, we develop a sample-level prompt refinement method to make it easier. With this method, users only need to provide sample-level feedback (e.g., which samples are undesired) to obtain better prompts. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the multi-modal projection method, improved model performance in the case study for both classification and object detection tasks, and positive feedback from the experts.

Model: On the Efficacy of Multi-scale Data Samplers for Vision Applications
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04502v1.pdf
Summary: Multi-scale resolution training has seen an increased adoption across multiple vision tasks, including classification and detection. Training with smaller resolutions enables faster training at the expense of a drop in accuracy. Conversely, training with larger resolutions has been shown to improve performance, but memory constraints often make this infeasible. In this paper, we empirically study the properties of multi-scale training procedures. We focus on variable batch size multi-scale data samplers that randomly sample an input resolution at each training iteration and dynamically adjust their batch size according to the resolution. Such samplers have been shown to improve model accuracy beyond standard training with a fixed batch size and resolution, though it is not clear why this is the case. We explore the properties of these data samplers by performing extensive experiments on ResNet-101 and validate our conclusions across multiple architectures, tasks, and datasets. We show that multi-scale samplers behave as implicit data regularizers and accelerate training speed. Compared to models trained with single-scale samplers, we show that models trained with multi-scale samplers retain or improve accuracy, while being better-calibrated and more robust to scaling and data distribution shifts. We additionally extend a multi-scale variable batch sampler with a simple curriculum that progressively grows resolutions throughout training, allowing for a compute reduction of more than 30%. We show that the benefits of multi-scale training extend to detection and instance segmentation tasks, where we observe a 37% reduction in training FLOPs along with a 3-4% mAP increase on MS-COCO using a Mask R-CNN model.
