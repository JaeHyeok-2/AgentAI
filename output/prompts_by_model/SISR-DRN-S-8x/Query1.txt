You are an AI scientist.

A user has asked the following question:
"I tried upscaling an image that was nearly reduced to a few pixels by 8x, and the AI still managed to give a coherent output. What kind of techniques or model structures are critical when so much information needs to be predicted?"

Based on the following recommended models, explain:

1. What task the user is trying to perform.
2. How the model(s) would work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow (input → model → output).
3. List relevant papers and tools (with GitHub or ArXiv links) that support your answer.

Model: Elastic-DETR: Making Image Resolution Learnable with Content-Specific Network Prediction
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06341v1.pdf
Summary: Multi-scale image resolution is a de facto standard approach in modern object detectors, such as DETR. This technique allows for the acquisition of various scale information from multiple image resolutions. However, manual hyperparameter selection of the resolution can restrict its flexibility, which is informed by prior knowledge, necessitating human intervention. This work introduces a novel strategy for learnable resolution, called Elastic-DETR, enabling elastic utilization of multiple image resolutions. Our network provides an adaptive scale factor based on the content of the image with a compact scale prediction module (< 2 GFLOPs). The key aspect of our method lies in how to determine the resolution without prior knowledge. We present two loss functions derived from identified key components for resolution optimization: scale loss, which increases adaptiveness according to the image, and distribution loss, which determines the overall degree of scaling based on network performance. By leveraging the resolution's flexibility, we can demonstrate various models that exhibit varying trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity. We empirically show that our scheme can unleash the potential of a wide spectrum of image resolutions without constraining flexibility. Our models on MS COCO establish a maximum accuracy gain of 3.5%p or 26% decrease in computation than MS-trained DN-DETR.

Model: Make Me a BNN: A Simple Strategy for Estimating Bayesian Uncertainty from Pre-trained Models
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15297v1.pdf
Summary: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for various computer vision tasks, yet they often struggle with reliable uncertainty quantification - a critical requirement for real-world applications. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) are equipped for uncertainty estimation but cannot scale to large DNNs that are highly unstable to train. To address this challenge, we introduce the Adaptable Bayesian Neural Network (ABNN), a simple and scalable strategy to seamlessly transform DNNs into BNNs in a post-hoc manner with minimal computational and training overheads. ABNN preserves the main predictive properties of DNNs while enhancing their uncertainty quantification abilities through simple BNN adaptation layers (attached to normalization layers) and a few fine-tuning steps on pre-trained models. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, and our results demonstrate that ABNN achieves state-of-the-art performance without the computational budget typically associated with ensemble methods.

Model: FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16025v1.pdf
Summary: The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.
