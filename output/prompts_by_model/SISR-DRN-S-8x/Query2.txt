Model: Slowing Learning by Erasing Simple Features
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02820v1.pdf
Summary: Prior work suggests that neural networks tend to learn low-order moments of the data distribution first, before moving on to higher-order correlations. In this work, we derive a novel closed-form concept erasure method, QLEACE, which surgically removes all quadratically available information about a concept from a representation. Through comparisons with linear erasure (LEACE) and two approximate forms of quadratic erasure, we explore whether networks can still learn when low-order statistics are removed from image classification datasets. We find that while LEACE consistently slows learning, quadratic erasure can exhibit both positive and negative effects on learning speed depending on the choice of dataset, model architecture, and erasure method.   Use of QLEACE consistently slows learning in feedforward architectures, but more sophisticated architectures learn to use injected higher order Shannon information about class labels. Its approximate variants avoid injecting information, but surprisingly act as data augmentation techniques on some datasets, enhancing learning speed compared to LEACE.

Model: ImageNet-Hard: The Hardest Images Remaining from a Study of the Power of Zoom and Spatial Biases in Image Classification
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05538v4.pdf
Summary: Image classifiers are information-discarding machines, by design. Yet, how these models discard information remains mysterious. We hypothesize that one way for image classifiers to reach high accuracy is to first zoom to the most discriminative region in the image and then extract features from there to predict image labels, discarding the rest of the image. Studying six popular networks ranging from AlexNet to CLIP, we find that proper framing of the input image can lead to the correct classification of 98.91% of ImageNet images. Furthermore, we uncover positional biases in various datasets, especially a strong center bias in two popular datasets: ImageNet-A and ObjectNet. Finally, leveraging our insights into the potential of zooming, we propose a test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions. Our method is more interpretable, accurate, and faster than MEMO, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTA method. We introduce ImageNet-Hard, a new benchmark that challenges SOTA classifiers including large vision-language models even when optimal zooming is allowed.

Model: InfoNCE Loss Provably Learns Cluster-Preserving Representations
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07920v1.pdf
Summary: The goal of contrasting learning is to learn a representation that preserves underlying clusters by keeping samples with similar content, e.g. the ``dogness'' of a dog, close to each other in the space generated by the representation. A common and successful approach for tackling this unsupervised learning problem is minimizing the InfoNCE loss associated with the training samples, where each sample is associated with their augmentations (positive samples such as rotation, crop) and a batch of negative samples (unrelated samples). To the best of our knowledge, it was unanswered if the representation learned by minimizing the InfoNCE loss preserves the underlying data clusters, as it only promotes learning a representation that is faithful to augmentations, i.e., an image and its augmentations have the same representation. Our main result is to show that the representation learned by InfoNCE with a finite number of negative samples is also consistent with respect to clusters in the data, under the condition that the augmentation sets within clusters may be non-overlapping but are close and intertwined, relative to the complexity of the learning function class.
