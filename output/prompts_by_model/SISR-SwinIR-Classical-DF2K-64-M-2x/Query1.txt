Summary: The rapid advancement of high-quality image generation models based on AI has generated a deluge of anime illustrations. Recommending illustrations to users within massive data has become a challenging and popular task. However, existing anime recommendation systems have focused on text features but still need to integrate image features. In addition, most multi-modal recommendation research is constrained by tightly coupled datasets, limiting its applicability to anime illustrations. We propose the User-aware Multi-modal Animation Illustration Recommendation Fusion with Painting Style (UMAIR-FPS) to tackle these gaps. In the feature extract phase, for image features, we are the first to combine image painting style features with semantic features to construct a dual-output image encoder for enhancing representation. For text features, we obtain text embeddings based on fine-tuning Sentence-Transformers by incorporating domain knowledge that composes a variety of domain text pairs from multilingual mappings, entity relationships, and term explanation perspectives, respectively. In the multi-modal fusion phase, we novelly propose a user-aware multi-modal contribution measurement mechanism to weight multi-modal features dynamically according to user features at the interaction level and employ the DCN-V2 module to model bounded-degree multi-modal crosses effectively. UMAIR-FPS surpasses the stat-of-the-art baselines on large real-world datasets, demonstrating substantial performance enhancements.

Model: ARTxAI: Explainable Artificial Intelligence Curates Deep Representation Learning for Artistic Images using Fuzzy Techniques
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15284v1.pdf
Summary: Automatic art analysis employs different image processing techniques to classify and categorize works of art. When working with artistic images, we need to take into account further considerations compared to classical image processing. This is because such artistic paintings change drastically depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style. This can result in features that perform very well in a given task but do not grasp the whole of the visual and symbolic information contained in a painting. In this paper, we show how the features obtained from different tasks in artistic image classification are suitable to solve other ones of similar nature. We present different methods to improve the generalization capabilities and performance of artistic classification systems. Furthermore, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence method to map known visual traits of an image with the features used by the deep learning model considering fuzzy rules. These rules show the patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task and how effective is each of the patterns found. Our results show that our proposed context-aware features can achieve up to $6\%$ and $26\%$ more accurate results than other context- and non-context-aware solutions, respectively, depending on the specific task. We also show that some of the features used by these models can be more clearly correlated to visual traits in the original image than others.

Model: REAL: Realism Evaluation of Text-to-Image Generation Models for Effective Data Augmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10663v1.pdf
Summary: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation models have transformed the field. However, challenges persist in generating images that reflect demanding textual descriptions, especially for fine-grained details and unusual relationships. Existing evaluation metrics focus on text-image alignment but overlook the realism of the generated image, which can be crucial for downstream applications like data augmentation in machine learning. To address this gap, we propose REAL, an automatic evaluation framework that assesses realism of T2I outputs along three dimensions: fine-grained visual attributes, unusual visual relationships, and visual styles. REAL achieves a Spearman's rho score of up to 0.62 in alignment with human judgement and demonstrates utility in ranking and filtering augmented data for tasks like image captioning, classification, and visual relationship detection. Empirical results show that high-scoring images evaluated by our metrics improve F1 scores of image classification by up to 11.3%, while low-scoring ones degrade that by up to 4.95%. We benchmark four major T2I models across the realism dimensions, providing insights for future improvements in T2I output realism.
