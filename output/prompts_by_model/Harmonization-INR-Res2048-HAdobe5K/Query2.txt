Model: DreamColour: Controllable Video Colour Editing without Training
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05180v1.pdf
Summary: Video colour editing is a crucial task for content creation, yet existing solutions either require painstaking frame-by-frame manipulation or produce unrealistic results with temporal artefacts. We present a practical, training-free framework that makes precise video colour editing accessible through an intuitive interface while maintaining professional-quality output. Our key insight is that by decoupling spatial and temporal aspects of colour editing, we can better align with users' natural workflow -- allowing them to focus on precise colour selection in key frames before automatically propagating changes across time. We achieve this through a novel technical framework that combines: (i) a simple point-and-click interface merging grid-based colour selection with automatic instance segmentation for precise spatial control, (ii) bidirectional colour propagation that leverages inherent video motion patterns, and (iii) motion-aware blending that ensures smooth transitions even with complex object movements. Through extensive evaluation on diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods while eliminating the need for training or specialized hardware, making professional-quality video colour editing accessible to everyone.

Model: Online Overexposed Pixels Hallucination in Videos with Adaptive Reference Frame Selection
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15462v1.pdf
Summary: Low dynamic range (LDR) cameras cannot deal with wide dynamic range inputs, frequently leading to local overexposure issues. We present a learning-based system to reduce these artifacts without resorting to complex acquisition mechanisms like alternating exposures or costly processing that are typical of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. We propose a transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) to infer the missing HDR details. In an ablation study, we show the importance of using a multiscale DNN and train it with the proper cost function to achieve state-of-the-art quality. To aid the reconstruction of the overexposed areas, our DNN takes a reference frame from the past as an additional input. This leverages the commonly occurring temporal instabilities of autoexposure to our advantage: since well-exposed details in the current frame may be overexposed in the future, we use reinforcement learning to train a reference frame selection DNN that decides whether to adopt the current frame as a future reference. Without resorting to alternating exposures, we obtain therefore a causal, HDR hallucination algorithm with potential application in common video acquisition settings.

Model: SI-FID: Only One Objective Indicator for Evaluating Stitched Images
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13905v1.pdf
Summary: Image quality evaluation accurately is vital in developing image stitching algorithms as it directly reflects the algorithms progress. However, commonly used objective indicators always produce inconsistent and even conflicting results with subjective indicators. To enhance the consistency between objective and subjective evaluations, this paper introduces a novel indicator the Frechet Distance for Stitched Images (SI-FID). To be specific, our training network employs the contrastive learning architecture overall. We employ data augmentation approaches that serve as noise to distort images in the training set. Both the initial and distorted training sets are then input into the pre-training model for fine-tuning. We then evaluate the altered FID after introducing interference to the test set and examine if the noise can improve the consistency between objective and subjective evaluation results. The rank correlation coefficient is utilized to measure the consistency. SI-FID is an altered FID that generates the highest rank correlation coefficient under the effect of a certain noise. The experimental results demonstrate that the rank correlation coefficient obtained by SI-FID is at least 25% higher than other objective indicators, which means achieving evaluation results closer to human subjective evaluation.
