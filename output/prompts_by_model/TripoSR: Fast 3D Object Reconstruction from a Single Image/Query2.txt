Model: Can robots mold soft plastic materials by shaping depth images?
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09848v1.pdf
Summary: Can robots mold soft plastic materials by shaping depth images? The short answer is no: current day robots can't. In this article, we address the problem of shaping plastic material with an anthropomorphic arm/hand robot, which observes the material with a fixed depth camera. Robots capable of molding could assist humans in many tasks, such as cooking, scooping or gardening. Yet, the problem is complex, due to its high-dimensionality at both perception and control levels. To address it, we design three alternative data-based methods for predicting the effect of robot actions on the material. Then, the robot can plan the sequence of actions and their positions, to mold the material into a desired shape. To make the prediction problem tractable, we rely on two original ideas. First, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, the shaping problem can be mapped from point cloud to depth image space, with many benefits (simpler processing, no need for registration, lower computation time and memory requirements). Second, we design a novel, simple metric for quickly measuring the distance between two depth images. The metric is based on the inherent point cloud representation of depth images, which enables direct and consistent comparison of image pairs through a non-uniform scaling approach, and therefore opens promising perspectives for designing \textit{depth image -- based} robot controllers. We assess our approach in a series of unprecedented experiments, where a robotic arm/hand molds flour from initial to final shapes, either with its own dataset, or by transfer learning from a human dataset. We conclude the article by discussing the limitations of our framework and those of current day hardware, which make human-like robot molding a challenging open research problem.

Model: Polygonizer: An auto-regressive building delineator
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04048v1.pdf
Summary: In geospatial planning, it is often essential to represent objects in a vectorized format, as this format easily translates to downstream tasks such as web development, graphics, or design. While these problems are frequently addressed using semantic segmentation, which requires additional post-processing to vectorize objects in a non-trivial way, we present an Image-to-Sequence model that allows for direct shape inference and is ready for vector-based workflows out of the box. We demonstrate the model's performance in various ways, including perturbations to the image input that correspond to variations or artifacts commonly encountered in remote sensing applications. Our model outperforms prior works when using ground truth bounding boxes (one object per image), achieving the lowest maximum tangent angle error.

Model: Fine-Tuned but Zero-Shot 3D Shape Sketch View Similarity and Retrieval
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08541v2.pdf
Summary: Recently, encoders like ViT (vision transformer) and ResNet have been trained on vast datasets and utilized as perceptual metrics for comparing sketches and images, as well as multi-domain encoders in a zero-shot setting. However, there has been limited effort to quantify the granularity of these encoders. Our work addresses this gap by focusing on multi-modal 2D projections of individual 3D instances. This task holds crucial implications for retrieval and sketch-based modeling. We show that in a zero-shot setting, the more abstract the sketch, the higher the likelihood of incorrect image matches. Even within the same sketch domain, sketches of the same object drawn in different styles, for example by distinct individuals, might not be accurately matched. One of the key findings of our research is that meticulous fine-tuning on one class of 3D shapes can lead to improved performance on other shape classes, reaching or surpassing the accuracy of supervised methods. We compare and discuss several fine-tuning strategies. Additionally, we delve deeply into how the scale of an object in a sketch influences the similarity of features at different network layers, helping us identify which network layers provide the most accurate matching. Significantly, we discover that ViT and ResNet perform best when dealing with similar object scales. We believe that our work will have a significant impact on research in the sketch domain, providing insights and guidance on how to adopt large pretrained models as perceptual losses.
