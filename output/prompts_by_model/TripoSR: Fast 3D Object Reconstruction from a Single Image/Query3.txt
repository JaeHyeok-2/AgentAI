Summary: Understanding the limitations and weaknesses of state-of-the-art models in artificial intelligence is crucial for their improvement and responsible application. In this research, we focus on CLIP, a model renowned for its integration of vision and language processing. Our objective is to uncover recurring problems and blind spots in CLIP's image comprehension. By delving into both the commonalities and disparities between CLIP and human image understanding, we augment our comprehension of these models' capabilities. Through our analysis, we reveal significant discrepancies in CLIP's interpretation of images compared to human perception, shedding light on areas requiring improvement. Our methodologies, the Discrepancy Analysis Framework (DAF) and the Transformative Caption Analysis for CLIP (TCAC), enable a comprehensive evaluation of CLIP's performance. We identify 14 systemic faults, including Action vs. Stillness confusion, Failure to identify the direction of movement or positioning of objects in the image, Hallucination of Water-like Features, Misattribution of Geographic Context, among others. By addressing these limitations, we lay the groundwork for the development of more accurate and nuanced image embedding models, contributing to advancements in artificial intelligence.

Model: 3D Keypoint Estimation Using Implicit Representation Learning
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11529v1.pdf
Summary: In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of 3D keypoint estimation of general objects using a novel implicit representation. Previous works have demonstrated promising results for keypoint prediction through direct coordinate regression or heatmap-based inference. However, these methods are commonly studied for specific subjects, such as human bodies and faces, which possess fixed keypoint structures. They also suffer in several practical scenarios where explicit or complete geometry is not given, including images and partial point clouds. Inspired by the recent success of advanced implicit representation in reconstruction tasks, we explore the idea of using an implicit field to represent keypoints. Specifically, our key idea is employing spheres to represent 3D keypoints, thereby enabling the learnability of the corresponding signed distance field. Explicit keypoints can be extracted subsequently by our algorithm based on the Hough transform. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations also show the superiority of our representation in terms of prediction accuracy.

Model: Explaining Object Detectors via Collective Contribution of Pixels
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00666v1.pdf
Summary: Visual explanations for object detectors are crucial for enhancing their reliability. Since object detectors identify and localize instances by assessing multiple features collectively, generating explanations that capture these collective contributions is critical. However, existing methods focus solely on individual pixel contributions, ignoring the collective contribution of multiple pixels. To address this, we proposed a method for object detectors that considers the collective contribution of multiple pixels. Our approach leverages game-theoretic concepts, specifically Shapley values and interactions, to provide explanations. These explanations cover both bounding box generation and class determination, considering both individual and collective pixel contributions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method more accurately identifies important regions in detection results compared to current state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available soon.
