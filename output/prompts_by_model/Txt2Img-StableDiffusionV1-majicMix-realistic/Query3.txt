Summary: Assessing the quality of artificial intelligence-generated images (AIGIs) plays a crucial role in their application in real-world scenarios. However, traditional image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms primarily focus on low-level visual perception, while existing IQA works on AIGIs overemphasize the generated content itself, neglecting its effectiveness in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AIGI-VC, a quality assessment database for AI-Generated Images in Visual Communication, which studies the communicability of AIGIs in the advertising field from the perspectives of information clarity and emotional interaction. The dataset consists of 2,500 images spanning 14 advertisement topics and 8 emotion types. It provides coarse-grained human preference annotations and fine-grained preference descriptions, benchmarking the abilities of IQA methods in preference prediction, interpretation, and reasoning. We conduct an empirical study of existing representative IQA methods and large multi-modal models on the AIGI-VC dataset, uncovering their strengths and weaknesses.

Model: REAL: Realism Evaluation of Text-to-Image Generation Models for Effective Data Augmentation
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10663v1.pdf
Summary: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation models have transformed the field. However, challenges persist in generating images that reflect demanding textual descriptions, especially for fine-grained details and unusual relationships. Existing evaluation metrics focus on text-image alignment but overlook the realism of the generated image, which can be crucial for downstream applications like data augmentation in machine learning. To address this gap, we propose REAL, an automatic evaluation framework that assesses realism of T2I outputs along three dimensions: fine-grained visual attributes, unusual visual relationships, and visual styles. REAL achieves a Spearman's rho score of up to 0.62 in alignment with human judgement and demonstrates utility in ranking and filtering augmented data for tasks like image captioning, classification, and visual relationship detection. Empirical results show that high-scoring images evaluated by our metrics improve F1 scores of image classification by up to 11.3%, while low-scoring ones degrade that by up to 4.95%. We benchmark four major T2I models across the realism dimensions, providing insights for future improvements in T2I output realism.

Model: Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing
Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06657v2.pdf
GitHub: https://github.com/felixcheng97/agap
Summary: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.
