ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"Enlarging old photos used to make them worse, but now AI actually restores them. How does that work?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?

The user is trying to understand how the provided AI model(s) solve a specific perception or generation task based on limited input information. This involves interpreting how the model infers the correct output from subtle or indirect cues.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**  
- **Input**: Structured data such as a single image, text prompt, video frame, or scene description.
- **Model**: The listed models process this input using learned feature representations (e.g., convolutional networks, transformer-based encoders, or diffusion models), sometimes guided by prompts or auxiliary data like depth maps or pose.
- **Output**: The model generates a structured output (e.g., video, segmentation map, depth estimation, classification tag) aligned with the task objective and training distribution.
