ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"I snapped a selfie while running and it turned out super blurry, but the AI fixed it right away. How does it recover such motion-blurred images so cleanly? Can this work instantly on phones too?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?
The user is trying to understand how a model achieves a particular behavior in a real-world scenario, such as tracking, generation, or classification. Based on the question, the task likely falls under one of the following categories: object tracking, image-to-video generation, pose-to-motion conversion, or content moderation.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**:
- The **input** is typically a static image, text description, sketch, or video sequence.
- The **model** processes the input using its architecture (e.g., diffusion, transformer, CNN), guided by the pretrained features or control signals like pose, semantics, or spatial constraints.
- The **output** is a video, prediction label, mask, or stylized version of the input that reflects learned distributions from the training set.

These models are tailored to their specific tasks. For example, video generation models use temporal consistency modules, while tracking models use attention or re-ID embeddings to focus on consistent targets.
