üß† **User Question:**  
"I uploaded an old vacation photo, and the AI described it as ‚Äúa family walking on a beach at sunset.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt give it any hints‚Äîhow does it generate such accurate descriptions just from a photo?"

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input ‚Üí Model ‚Üí Output**  
- **Input**: Structured data such as a single image, text prompt, video frame, or scene description.
- **Model**: The listed models process this input using learned feature representations (e.g., convolutional networks, transformer-based encoders, or diffusion models), sometimes guided by prompts or auxiliary data like depth maps or pose.
- **Output**: The model generates a structured output (e.g., video, segmentation map, depth estimation, classification tag) aligned with the task objective and training distribution.
