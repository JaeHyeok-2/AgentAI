ðŸ§  **User Question:**  
"Even when I added new objects mid-training, it adapted fast and didnâ€™t fall apart. What kind of matching process helps it stay so stable?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?
The user is trying to understand how a model achieves a particular behavior in a real-world scenario, such as tracking, generation, or classification. Based on the question, the task likely falls under one of the following categories: object tracking, image-to-video generation, pose-to-motion conversion, or content moderation.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input â†’ Model â†’ Output**:
- The **input** is typically a static image, text description, sketch, or video sequence.
- The **model** processes the input using its architecture (e.g., diffusion, transformer, CNN), guided by the pretrained features or control signals like pose, semantics, or spatial constraints.
- The **output** is a video, prediction label, mask, or stylized version of the input that reflects learned distributions from the training set.

These models are tailored to their specific tasks. For example, video generation models use temporal consistency modules, while tracking models use attention or re-ID embeddings to focus on consistent targets.
