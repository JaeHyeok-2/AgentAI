üß† **User Question:**  
"I typed ‚Äúa panda dancing in the snow‚Äù and it made a super smooth video in seconds‚Äîhow can it create motion just from text?"

### 1. What task is the user trying to perform?
The user is trying to understand how a model achieves a particular behavior in a real-world scenario, such as tracking, generation, or classification. Based on the question, the task likely falls under one of the following categories: object tracking, image-to-video generation, pose-to-motion conversion, or content moderation.

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input ‚Üí Model ‚Üí Output**:
- The **input** is typically a static image, text description, sketch, or video sequence.
- The **model** processes the input using its architecture (e.g., diffusion, transformer, CNN), guided by the pretrained features or control signals like pose, semantics, or spatial constraints.
- The **output** is a video, prediction label, mask, or stylized version of the input that reflects learned distributions from the training set.
