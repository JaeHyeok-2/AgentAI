üß† **User Question:**  
"I generated a ‚Äúvivid fantasy heroine,‚Äù and the result mixed comic lines with oil-paint strokes and even had a subtle 2.5-D depth. How does AI layer styles to blend looks and add that slight parallax feel?"

### 2. How does the model work in a CNAPS AI-like workflow?

**Input ‚Üí Model ‚Üí Output**  
- **Input**: Structured data such as a single image, text prompt, video frame, or scene description.
- **Model**: The listed models process this input using learned feature representations (e.g., convolutional networks, transformer-based encoders, or diffusion models), sometimes guided by prompts or auxiliary data like depth maps or pose.
- **Output**: The model generates a structured output (e.g., video, segmentation map, depth estimation, classification tag) aligned with the task objective and training distribution.
