### Brief Justification
- **llm_a**: This response is clear and well-organized, providing a comprehensive and detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow. It effectively uses the provided models and includes a robust branching and merging logic, making it highly interpretable. The justification for the choice of models and workflow design is well articulated, leveraging the strengths of each model effectively for the task at hand.

- **llm_b**: While the response is clear, it lacks the depth and detail in the workflow design compared to llm_a. The branching logic is less sophisticated, and the reasoning behind model choices is not as thoroughly explained. Although it uses the provided models correctly, the overall design feels more linear and less adapted to the CNAPS-style framework.

- **llm_c**: This response provides a detailed workflow and uses the provided models appropriately. It includes good interpretability and rationale for model choice, but the clarity and readability could be improved. The design and explanation are solid, but not as refined as llm_a in articulating the CNAPS-style approach and the integration of different modules.
