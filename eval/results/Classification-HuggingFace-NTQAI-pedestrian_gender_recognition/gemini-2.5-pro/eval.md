### Brief Justification
- **llm_a**: This response presents the most sophisticated and conceptually powerful CNAPS-style workflow. It correctly interprets the paradigm as a multi-modal fusion system, where the input is analyzed in two parallel, complementary branches (direct classification and pose-based analysis). The "Decision Fusion" module is a true merging point that weighs evidence from both branches, creating a robust system that is greater than the sum of its parts. This design is innovative, well-justified, and perfectly suited to the ambiguity of the user's problem.

- **llm_b**: This response proposes a simple linear pipeline, not a CNAPS-style workflow with branching and merging. It describes a sequence of operations (detect, then classify) which, while logical, fails to meet the core architectural requirement of the prompt. The descriptions are also sparse and lack the detail and structure of the other responses, resulting in lower scores for clarity, completeness, and reasoning.

- **llm_c**: This is an excellent response and a very close runner-up. It presents a clear, practical, and correct "scatter-gather" (or fan-out/fan-in) CNAPS workflow. The branching logic (one branch per detected person) is perfectly valid and extremely well-explained with a superb diagram and justification. It loses a single point to llm_a on workflow design only because llm_a's multi-modal fusion approach is a slightly more advanced concept, involving the parallel processing of different *types* of analysis rather than just parallelizing the same task.
