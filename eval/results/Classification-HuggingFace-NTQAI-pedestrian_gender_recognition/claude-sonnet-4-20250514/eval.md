### Brief Justification

- **llm_a**: Strong workflow design with clear branching/merging logic and good visual representation. However, the "pose-based gender analysis" module appears to be custom processing rather than using provided models, and some technical details lack precision. The dual-branch approach is sophisticated but adds complexity without clear justification.

- **llm_b**: Simple and straightforward approach but lacks true CNAPS-style branching/merging. The workflow is essentially linear (detect → classify → output) rather than demonstrating synaptic network principles. The explanation is brief and misses key technical details about how the models interact.

- **llm_c**: Excellent comprehensive response with clear "divide and conquer" synaptic design. Demonstrates true branching (single image → multiple person crops → parallel processing → merge results). Provides detailed technical justification, structured output format, and explicitly addresses why each model choice is optimal. The workflow genuinely reflects CNAPS principles with proper branching, parallel processing, and intelligent merging. Only minor deduction for slight verbosity.
