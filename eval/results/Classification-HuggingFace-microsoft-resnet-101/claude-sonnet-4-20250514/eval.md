### Brief Justification

- **llm_a**: Well-structured response with clear sections, but has critical flaws. Uses PoseEstimation-OpenPose appropriately but then references a pedestrian gender classification model that wasn't in the provided list. The workflow design shows some branching but lacks true CNAPS-style parallel processing and merging. The "Results Merger & Analysis" module is not from the provided models list, violating the constraints.

- **llm_b**: Shortest and least detailed response. Shows basic understanding of the task but fails to properly utilize the provided models - mentions "Object Classification Model" generically rather than using specific provided models. The workflow diagram is overly simplified and doesn't demonstrate true CNAPS-style branching/merging. Missing detailed technical specifications and proper model justifications.

- **llm_c**: Exemplary response that fully addresses all criteria. Uses only provided models (ObjectDetection-YOLOv8, ImageCaptioning-BLIP2, TextSummarization-BART) with clear justification for each choice. Demonstrates true CNAPS-style workflow with parallel processing branches that merge at a synthesis point. Provides detailed technical specifications, proper citations, and explicitly explains why unused models were excluded. The workflow design is sophisticated with clear branching, parallel processing, and convergence - exactly what CNAPS architecture requires.
