### Brief Justification
- **llm_a**: This response is well-structured and clear, but its proposed workflow is fundamentally flawed. It correctly identifies `OpenPose` for people but completely fails to address the animal detection task with an appropriate model from the list. It acknowledges this gap but doesn't solve it, instead adding a gender classification model that wasn't requested. The design does not fulfill the core requirements of the prompt.

- **llm_b**: This response has a decent high-level concept for a workflow but is very vague and fails on specifics. Crucially, it does not use the provided models. For animal detection, it hand-waves the problem by suggesting a generic "Object Classification Model" and admitting it doesn't know which specific model to use from the prompt. This failure to adhere to the primary constraints makes the solution invalid.

- **llm_c**: This response is exceptional and a clear winner. It demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the CNAPS paradigm by designing a workflow with parallel branches for quantitative (`YOLOv8`) and qualitative (`BLIP2`) analysis, which are then merged and synthesized by a final model (`BART`). It correctly selects the best model for each sub-task, provides impeccable reasoning for its choices, and even justifies the exclusion of other models. The solution is clear, complete, and perfectly aligned with all evaluation criteria.
