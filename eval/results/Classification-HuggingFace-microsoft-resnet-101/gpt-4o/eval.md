### Brief Justification
- **llm_a**: The response provides a clear and structured explanation, but it lacks completeness in addressing the animal detection part. It uses models not listed in the prompt and does not fully justify its choices based on the provided models.

- **llm_b**: This response outlines a basic workflow but lacks depth in the explanation of model choices and does not explicitly use the models as required by the prompt. It introduces models not mentioned in the task description, such as YOLO or ResNet, which are not part of the provided models.

- **llm_c**: This response excels in clarity and completeness, providing a detailed and well-organized workflow using only the models listed. It thoroughly explains the reasoning behind model choices and effectively integrates all aspects of the task into a comprehensive CNAPS-style workflow. The choice of modules is well-justified, making it the most accurate and aligned with the task requirements.
