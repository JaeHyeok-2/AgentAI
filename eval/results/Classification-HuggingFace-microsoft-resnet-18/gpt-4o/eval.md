### Brief Justification
- **llm_a**: This response provides a well-structured and clear explanation. It effectively uses a CNAPS-style workflow with real branching logic, ensuring both privacy and detailed scene description are handled appropriately. The use of provided models is justified, and the reasoning is clear and aligned with the task requirements.

- **llm_b**: While the response is clear, it lacks the depth of CNAPS-style workflow design as seen in llm_a. The description of the process is somewhat brief, and the merging logic is not as robustly detailed. However, it correctly uses the provided models.

- **llm_c**: This response is detailed and clear, with a strong CNAPS-style workflow. It effectively incorporates branching logic and uses the provided models appropriately. The reasoning is well-justified, but the explanation could be slightly more concise, which affected its readability score compared to llm_a.
