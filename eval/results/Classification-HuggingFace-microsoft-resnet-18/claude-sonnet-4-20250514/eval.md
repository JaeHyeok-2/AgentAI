### Brief Justification

- **llm_a**: Good technical depth and clear visual flow diagram, but misunderstands the core task. The user wants simple "person" output when humans are detected, not detailed descriptions with privacy filtering. The workflow is overly complex for the actual requirement and doesn't implement true branching logic with conditional outputs.

- **llm_b**: Clearest understanding of the basic task but lacks proper CNAPS-style design. The workflow is essentially linear with parallel processing rather than true branching with conditional logic gates. The flow diagram is too simplified and doesn't show genuine synaptic network characteristics.

- **llm_c**: Excellent comprehension of both the task requirements and CNAPS architecture. Correctly implements conditional branching with a clear "synaptic junction" that makes binary decisions based on person detection. The workflow genuinely branches and merges with conditional logic, perfectly matching the user's "if person detected → 'a person', else → detailed description" requirement. Well-structured presentation with proper technical justification.
