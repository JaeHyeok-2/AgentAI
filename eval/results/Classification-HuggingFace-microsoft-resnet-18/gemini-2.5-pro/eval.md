### Brief Justification
- **llm_a**: This is a very strong response with excellent clarity and structure. Its interpretation of the task as "fusing" a scene description with a generic "person" tag is sophisticated. However, its workflow design has a hidden complexity: the "Content Filtering" and "Fusion" modules would require a complex NLP step to parse the BLIP caption and intelligently combine it with the privacy flag. This step is not detailed, making the proposed design less robust and immediately feasible than it appears.

- **llm_b**: This response correctly identifies the core task and necessary models but lacks the detail and structural clarity of the other two. Its workflow diagram is high-level, and the merging logic—"Replace person-specific tokens"—is vague and suffers from the same feasibility problem as llm_a's design, but with even
