### Brief Justification
- **llm_a**: This response stood out for its clear and well-organized explanation, effectively covering the CNAPS-style workflow with real branching and merging logic. It utilized the provided models appropriately and offered a strong rationale for model selection and decision-making, ensuring a comprehensive and understandable approach to the task.
  
- **llm_b**: While offering a coherent structure, this response lacked depth in the branching logic and did not fully elaborate on the decision-making process. It used the provided models correctly but could have benefited from more detailed integration and reasoning about the workflow and interpretation.

- **llm_c**: This response was detailed and well-structured, with a solid explanation of the CNAPS-style approach. However, it was slightly less clear in some areas compared to llm_a, and the explanation of the workflow design could have been more concise. It still provided a good use of models and reasoning, making it a strong contender.
