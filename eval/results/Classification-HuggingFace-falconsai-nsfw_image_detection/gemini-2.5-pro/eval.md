### Brief Justification
- **llm_a**: A very strong and well-structured response. It clearly understands the task and presents a valid CNAPS workflow with parallel processing and a fusion module. The reasoning for model selection is excellent. Its only minor flaw is a slightly confusing flow diagram where the parallel nature of the inputs isn't perfectly represented visually, though the text clarifies the intent.

- **llm_b**: This response is adequate but the weakest of the three. While it identifies the correct models and tasks, its workflow design is more sequential than parallel, which misses the core of the CNAPS concept. The diagram and the description of the "Interpretation Module" are simplistic, and the justification for its design is less detailed and persuasive than the other two.

- **llm_c**: This is an outstanding response and the clear winner. It excels in every category, particularly in its workflow design. The use of a `mermaid` diagram is highly effective and perfectly illustrates the parallel branching. Crucially, it introduces sophisticated **conditional logic** into its "Synthesizer" module, where the workflow path changes based on the confidence of the initial NSFW classification. This nuanced, adaptive logic is the best representation of a CNAPS-style system among the three options. The justifications are detailed, insightful, and clearly connect each component to the overall goal.
